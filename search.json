SeaWiFS files subset using coordinates prior begin downloaded Ocean Color Web Browser. SeaDAS’s L2GEN program used generate Level 2 (L2) files using default settings optimal ancillary files, L2BIN program spatially temporally aggregated L2 files create daily Level 3 binned (L3B) files. daily files binned 2 km resolution stored global, nearly equal-area, integerized sinusoidal grids use default L2 ocean color flag masks. global SST data also subset East Coast region remapped sinusoidal grid.L2 files contain several ocean color products including default chlorophyll ; product (CHL-OCI), photosynthetic available radiation (PAR), remote sensing reflectance \\((R_{rs}(\\lambda))\\), several inherent optical property products (IOPs). CHL-OCI product combines two algorithms, O’Reilly band ratio (OCx) algorithm (O’Reilly et al. 1998) Hu color index (CI) algorithm (Hu, Lee, Franz 2012). SeaDAS default CHL-OCI algorithm diverges slightly Hu, Lee, Franz (2012) transition CI OCx occurs 0.15 < CI < 0.2 mg m-3 ensure smooth transition. regional chlorophyll algorithm Pan et al.
