	abstract = {During the past half-century notable changes have occurred in the Northeast U.S. (NEUS) Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). To understand how the system functions as a whole, to evaluate the potential responses of this ecosystem to numerous human-induced perturbations, and to elucidate the relative magnitude of key biota and processes, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center instituted the Energy Modeling and Analysis eXercise (EMAX). The primary goal of EMAX was to establish an ecological network model (i.e., a more nuanced energy budget) of the entire Northeast U.S. food web. The EMAX work focused on the interdisciplinary development of a network model which reflected contemporary conditions (1996–2000) in four major regions of the ecosystem:, Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, Southern New England and Middle Atlantic Bight. The model had 36 network “nodes” or biomass state variables across a broad range of the biological hierarchy within each trophic level and incorporated a wide range of key rate processes. Because this ecosystem has been relatively well studied many of the biomass estimates were based on field measurements and biomass estimates from the scientific literature were required only for a relatively small number of nodes. The emphasis of EMAX was to explore the particular role of small pelagic fishes in the ecosystem. Our results show that small pelagic fishes are indeed keystone species in the ecosystem. We examined a suite of novel ecosystem metrics as we compared the four regions and provided a general, system-level description of the NEUS ecosystem. The general patterns of the network properties in the four regions were similar; however the network indices and metrics did reveal some noteworthy differences among regions reflecting their different oceanographic and faunal characteristics. The process of compiling and evaluating available data required by an ecosystem network model identified important gaps in our understanding which should be addressed during future ecosystem surveys. Moreover, exercises like EMAX will be a valuable starting point as we continue to progress towards ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM).},

Increasing population pressure, declining fish stocks, and the attractiveness of natural amenities have all led to demographic shifts and economic transformations for many coastal communities dependent on fishing. This impact of “gentrification” on the commercial fishing industry often precipitates a move toward non-marine based economies that can displace local residents and their dependence on fishing as a way of life with resulting impacts to local economies and cultures. Drawing on the United States Census, National Marine Fisheries Service, and other secondary data sources, social indicators were developed for 2,948 coastal communities in the Eastern United States and Gulf Coast and were used to evaluate gentrification pressure in select communities highly engaged in fishing. We anticipate this methodology, when groundtruthed and then combined with time-series assessments, will lead to improvements in the assessment of fishing community vulnerability and resilience for the conduct of fisheries social impact assessments.},

This shift will require an adaptive response on the part of policy makers and fishery managers. In the U.S., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established, in its fisheries agency (NOAA Fisheries), a set of social indicators of fishing community vulnerability and resilience to evaluate the impacts of changes in fishery management regimes. These indicators enhance the analytical capabilities within NOAA Fisheries for conducting fisheries social impact assessments and informing ecosystem-based fishery management. Building on the existing Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs), new measures of climate change vulnerability are defined for the U.S. Eastern and Gulf coasts. These new indicators are used to assess the impact of sea level rise on critical commercial fishing infrastructure and the dependence of communities on species identified as vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Examples are provided in this article to demonstrate the utility of these new indicators to policy makers and the NOAA strategic goal for building resilient coastal communities that are environmentally and economically sustainable. Integration of CSVIs and the new climate change vulnerability indices highlight community needs for unique solutions in order to adapt to environmental and social changes and maintain their well-being.},

	abstract = {The economic and ecological impacts of fish consumption by marine mammals, the associated interactions with commercial fish stocks, and the forage demands of these marine mammal populations are largely unknown. Consumption estimates are often either data deficient or not fully evaluated in a rigorous, quantitative manner. Although consumption estimates exist for the Northeast United States (NEUS) Large Marine Ecosystem, there is considerable uncertainty in those estimates. We examined consumption estimates for 12 marine mammal species inhabiting the regional ecosystem. We used sensitivity analyses to examine metabolically driven daily individual consumption rates, resulting in a suite of feasible parameter-pair ranges for each of three taxonomic groups: mysticetes, odontocetes, and pinnipeds. We expanded daily individual consumption to annual consumption based on abundance estimates of marine mammals found on the NEUS continental shelf coupled with estimates of annual residence time for each species. To examine consumptive removals for specific prey, diet compositions were summarized into major prey categories, and predatory removals by marine mammal species as well as for total marine mammal consumption were estimated for each prey taxa. Bounds on consumption estimates for each marine mammal species were determined using Monte Carlo resampling simulations. Our results suggest that consumption for these 12 marine mammal species combined may be similar in magnitude to commercial fishery landings for small pelagic and groundfish prey groups. Consumption by marine mammals warrants consideration both as a source of mortality in assessments of prey stocks, and to determine marine mammal forage demands in ecosystem assessment models. The approach that we present represents a rigorous, quantitative method to scope the bounds of the biomass that marine mammals are expected to consume, and is appropriate for use in other ecosystems where the interaction between marine mammals and commercial fisheries is thought to be prominent.},

We describe the diagnostics that can be used to check for thermodynamic and ecological principles, and highlight principles that should be used for balancing a model. We then highlight the pitfalls when comparing Ecopath models using Ecological Network Analysis indices. For dynamic simulations in Ecosim we show the state of the art in calibrating the model by fitting it to time series using a formal fitting procedure and statistical goodness of fit. Finally, we show how Monte Carlo simulations can be used to address uncertainty in input parameters, and we discuss the use of models in a management context, specifically using the concept of ‘key runs’ for ecosystem-based management. This novel list of best practices for EwE models will enable ecosystem managers to evaluate the goodness of fit of the given EwE model to the ecosystem management question.},

	abstract = {The MARMAP hydrographic data set (1977–1987) is used to determine the mean annual cycle of temperature, salinity, and density structure of surface waters throughout the Gulf of Maine. The temperatures follow the expected seasonal warming and cooling pattern. In the eastern Gulf the salinity cycle is dominated by influx of low salinity Scotian Shelf water which enters near Cape Sable in the winter, and in the western Gulf by the local spring runoff. Phasing of temperature and salinity cycles in different parts of the Gulf results in the western Gulf of Maine being more strongly stratified in the summer and more vertically uniform in the winter than is the eastern Gulf. The interannual variability, derived by subtracting the annual cycles from the original data, reveals relatively little temperature variability (1–2°C) during the period 1977–1987, compared to observed changes of 4–6°C in previous decades. Large interannual changes in salinity (0.5 psu), however, are evident in the data. The salinity variability is shown to be due primarily to changes in local fresh water sources—precipitation and runoff. Comparison of salinity changes in the Gulf of Maine with data from Georges Bank and the Middle Atlantic Bight shows that the salinity variability is coherent over the northeast continental shelf region from the western Gulf (Wilkinson Basin) to Cape Hatteras.},

	abstract = {The circulation in the Gulf of Maine has an important baroclinic component. It appears to be driven mostly by the density contrast between high-salinity slope water which enters from the Atlantic and fresher waters which are formed in the Gulf or which enter from the Scotian shelf. Hydrographie surveys in three successive spring seasons suggest that slope water accumulates in Georges Basin, driving a counterclockwise surface circulation which brings Scotian shelf water westward into the Gulf and contributes to the eastward jet along the inner edge of Georges Bank. The slope water also crosses a sill and enters Jordan Basin, where it provides a potential energy source which may enhance a counterclockwise gyre partly driven by nearshore buoyancy sources and perhaps the wind. The coastal limb of the gyre turns offshore east of Penobscot Bay. Part of the separated coastal current recirculates in Jordan Basin, and part of it continues into Wilkinson Basin, generating a clockwise eddy as it passes over Jeffreys Bank. There is little evidence for recirculating surface flow in Wilkinson Basin. Instead, the surface water appears to split into branches feeding the Jordan Basin gyre, the Georges Bank jet, and an export path to Nantucket Shoals. The Jordan and Georges branches seem to be divided by the denser slope water in Georges Basin, and this may be the central process controlling the vernal intensification of the circulation in the Gulf. A more complete dynamical understanding awaits models which include the baroclinic influence of boundary waters.},

The average temperature and salinity of the bottom water are presented from the different surveys for four regions of the Gulf—Wilkinson, Jordan, and Georges Basins and the Northeast Channel. The spatial variability across the Gulf was larger than the temporal variability in any region. The bottom water originates from Slope Water that enters the Gulf through the Northeast Channel. It is modified within the Gulf by vertical mixing with the near-surface waters of Scotian Shelf origin. A box model for the property changes during the summer-fall period indicates that the advection and mixing processes are of approximately equal importance in determining the bottom water properties. A winter convective input to the bottom layers is shown to occur only from the coastal areas around Wilkinson Basin in years when the surface salinity there was relatively high ({\textgreater}33.0‰). Advection and mixing rates calculated by the box model are in agreement with direct measurements of the inflow to the Gulf (Ramp et al., 1985) and mixing estimates from a budget for the intermediate layer waters in the Gulf (Hopkins and Garfield, 1979).},

	title = {Regime {Shift} in the {Gulf} of {Maine}},
	abstract = {Conventional wisdom, based on observations spanning two and a half decades (1975–2000), asserts that inflow to the Gulf of Maine (GoM) occurs primarily in two areas: inshore on the Scotian Shelf off Cape Sable, Nova Scotia and on the eastern side of the Northeast Channel (NEC). In particular, the monthly mean currents in the eastern NEC have shown persistent inflow at all depths and in all seasons, except for the occasional, but brief, reversals near the bottom ({\textasciitilde}200 m). Conversely, the flow on the western side of the NEC is normally directed out of the gulf in the surface layer and at mid-depth, consistent with the clockwise gyre over Georges Bank, but those currents do show relatively frequent reversals to inflow in the deeper layers (150–200 m), in sympathy with the flow on the eastern side. At some point between the year 2000, when the last Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO)/U.S. GLOBEC mooring was removed from the eastern NEC, and 2004, when a new mooring was placed there as part of the U.S. ocean observing array, a transformation occurred. The recent data, collected from a representative location in the eastern NEC, show a strongly seasonal current signal marked by persistent periods of outflow in the deep layers ({\textgreater}100 m), particularly in winter. This observation was first reported by Pettigrew et al. (2008), where the outflow currents occasionally extend to the surface layers as well, most notably in the winters of 2004–2005 and 2006–2007. Additional data and analyses reported here suggest that this new mode of behavior in the NEC currents could have important consequences for the GoM ecosystem. Possible causes for this “regime shift” in the NEC circulation and implications for the GoM deepwater nutrient fields and ecosystem are discussed.},

	abstract = {Analysis of three years (October 1993–September 1996) of monthly mean current, temperature and salinity observations from moorings in the major Gulf of Maine (GOM) inflows off southwest Nova Scotia (C2) and in Northeast Channel (NECE) reveals some new features of the annual NECE cycles, including (1) a peak in near-surface ({\textless}75m) inflow in spring (vs. late summer at depth), suggesting that dynamic control of shallow and deep layers may be different, (2) a maximum near-surface cross-channel flow toward Georges Bank (GB) in late winter, suggesting a climatological tendency for Scotian Shelf “cross-overs” in that season, and (3) the absence of a significant salinity cycle over most of the water column. Deviations from the annual cycle indicate that the first part of the observation period was characterized by enhanced warm, saline, deep ({\textgreater}75m) NECE inflow, followed by later episodes of enhanced cold, fresh inflow at C2 and shallow NECE. Generally, the flow rates at C2 and deep NECE were out of phase, with increased inflow at C2 (deep NECE) associated with reduced inflow at deep NECE (C2) and cooler, fresher (warmer,saltier) conditions at both sites. Freshwater transport anomalies to the Gulf are maximum in the surface layers and largely negative(positive) over the first(last) half of the measurements. The timing of these freshwater inflow variations is consistent with observed fluctuations in hydrographic measurements in the GOM and GB, which reached peak salinities in late 1994, then declined through 1995–1996. Oxygen isotope analysis suggests that almost all of the fresh water present on the central cap of GB in 1996 and early 1997 is of northern (Scotian Shelf) origin as opposed to 1994 and 1995 when Maine River Waters contributed 38 and 26\%, respectively, to the freshwater (relative to 34.8) on the cap. A simple box model driven by observed changes in the boundary fluxes indicates that over the last half of the measurement period (April 1995–September 1996), the volumetric flow rate through the GOM increased by 105m3s−1 (roughly 17\% of the total transport, 5.83×105m3s−1), and that increased freshwater fluxes in the surface layers at C2 and NECE produced a net decrease of 0.73 in the salinity of the outflow waters. Average volumetric transports at C2(NECE) were roughly twice(half) those observed in the late 1970s, but the total is consistent with climtological estimates. The net change in the freshwater fluxes exceeds the total climatological mean estimate. Examination of possible local and remote sources confirms that the origin of the 1996–1997 freshwater anomaly is in the northern Labrador Sea/Baffin Bay and results from exceptionally cold winters in the early 1990s. Analysis of a similar event in the early 1980s suggests their occurrence is part of a quasi-decadal climate signal which follows the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).},

Comparison of the annual average \%LSW with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) lagged two years shows that both series have very similar, but opposite, long term trends. High \%LSW in the 1960s decreased to low values in the 1990s as the NAO increased from low to high values over the same period. A regression of the residuals of the two series from their long term trends also is signiﬁcant at the 5\% level, indicating that the \%LSW at the Northeast Channel has a persistent relationship on a year-to-year basis with the NAO over the full range of variation in the NAO. The response of the \%LSW to the NAO, however, appeared substantially reduced after about 1990. Changes in the potential nutrient ﬂux into the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank system associated with changes in the \%LSW cannot account for changes in chlorophyll a concentrations estimated for three multi-year stanzas during the sampling period.},

Results reveal a large phase lag in near bottom temperatures, with peak values occurring in September at the inner shelf, in October at the mid shelf, and in November at the outer shelf. Unlike the northern MAB, the seasonal cycle explains over 70\% of the near-surface salinity variability. At the inner shelf and offshore near the bottom, however, most of the variance is due to pulses in river discharge and to shifts in the position of the shelfbreak front. Cross-shelf density gradients inshore of the 60-m isobath are dominated by salinity during winter and spring, with temperature contributing significantly from August to October. This is because bottom waters near the coast are warm due to the deepening of the thermocline during fall, but offshore waters are still influenced by the cold pool. The vertical stratification seasonal variability is also large. Early in the year, stratification is small and entirely due to salinity. By May, salinity still dominates vertical gradients near the coast, but temperature and salinity contribute equally to the density stratification offshore. During summer, stratification is dominated by temperature. Temperature interannual variability was small during the sampling period, but surface salinity was anomalously low by 1.2 psu in summer 2006. The anomaly was due to larger than average discharge from the Hudson River in early summer during a period of strong upwelling favorable winds.},

Over the last century, temperatures along the northeastern U.S. coast have warmed at a rate 1.8–2.5 times the regional atmospheric temperature trend but are comparable to warming rates for the Arctic and Labrador, the source of coastal ocean waters north of Cape Hatteras (36°N). South of Cape Hatteras, coastal ocean temperature trends match the regional atmospheric temperature trend. The observations and a simple model show that along-shelf transport, associated with the mean coastal current system running from Labrador to Cape Hatteras, is the mechanism controlling long-term temperature changes for this region and not the local air–sea exchange of heat.},

	abstract = {Expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) have been launched along a repeat track from New Jersey to Bermuda from the CMV Oleander through the NOAA/NEFSC Ship of Opportunity Program about 14 times per year since 1977. The XBT temperatures on the Middle Atlantic Bight shelf are binned with 10 km horizontal and 5 m vertical resolution to produce monthly, seasonally, and annually averaged cross-shelf temperature sections. The depth-averaged shelf temperature, Ts, calculated from annually averaged sections that are spatially averaged across the shelf, increases at 0.026 ± 0.001°C yr−1 from 1977 to 2013, with the recent trend substantially larger than the overall 37 year trend (0.11 ± 0.02°C yr−1 since 2002). The Oleander temperature sections suggest that the recent acceleration in warming on the shelf is not confined to the surface, but occurs throughout the water column with some contribution from interactions between the shelf and the adjacent Slope Sea reflected in cross-shelf motions of the shelfbreak front. The local warming on the shelf cannot explain the region's amplified rate of sea level rise relative to the global mean. Additionally, Ts exhibits significant interannual variability with the warmest anomalies increasing in intensity over the 37 year record even as the cold anomalies remain relatively uniform throughout the record. Ts anomalies are not correlated with annually averaged coastal sea level anomalies at zero lag. However, positive correlation is found between 2 year lagged Ts anomalies and coastal sea level anomalies, suggesting that the region's sea level anomalies may serve as a predictor of shelf temperature.},

Historical temperature profiles are used to characterize the average annual evolution and spatial structure of the Cold Pool. The Cold Pool gradually warms from spring to summer at a rate of order 1°C month−1. The warming rate is faster in shallower water where the Cold Pool is thinner, consistent with a vertical turbulent heat flux from the thermocline to the Cold Pool. The Cold Pool warming rate also varies along the shelf; it is larger over Georges Bank and smaller in the southern MAB. The mean turbulent diffusivities at the top of the Cold Pool, estimated from the spring to summer mean heat balance, are an order of magnitude larger over Georges Bank than in the southern MAB, consistent with much stronger tidal mixing over Georges Bank than in the southern MAB. The stronger tidal mixing causes the Cold Pool to warm more rapidly over Georges Bank and the eastern New England shelf than in the New York Bight or southern MAB. Consequently, the coldest Cold Pool water is located in the New York Bight from late spring to summer.},

The variability is on the order of the mean current offshore and several times that of the mean current nearshore. The Hudson Shelf Valley and the shelf break act as dynamical boundaries that define the New Jersey Shelf. The surface flow on the New Jersey Shelf depends on topography, seasonal stratification, and wind forcing. The flow is in the approximate direction of the wind during the unstratified season and more to the right of the wind during the stratified season. During the stratified summer season, the dominant along-shore upwelling favorable winds from the SW drive cross-shelf offshore flow. During the unstratified/well-mixed winter season, the dominant cross-shore NW winds drive cross-shelf offshore flows. During the transition seasons of spring and autumn, along-shore NE winds, often associated with storm events, drive energetic down-shelf, along-shelf flows. The surface transport pathways are either cross-shelf dominated during summer and winter or along-shelf dominated during the transition seasons. The residence time of surface Lagrangian drifters on the New Jersey Shelf ranged from 1 to 7 weeks with summer and autumn showing faster transport than winter and spring.},

The experiment included a moored array of current meters and bottom instrumentation deployed at six locations across the shelf and upper slope spanning a depth range from 46 to 810 m, and supporting hydrographic observations. A basic description of the moored current and temperature data is given here with an emphasis on the low-frequency variability. In the summer period (April–August) when the local vertical stratification reached a maximum due to increased surface heating and reduced wind mixing, the mean flow over the shelf at all instruments was primarily along 1ocal isobaths towards the west. The subtidal current fluctuations were coherent both horizontally and vertically over the shelf, but not with current fluctuations observed over the upper slope. The wind stress during summer was weak and only moderately correlated with the subtidal current fluctuations. In the winter period (October–March), when the seasonal thermocline was destroyed and the shelf water locally homogenized by increased surface cooling and wind mixing, the mean currents observed over the shelf were also primarily alongshelf towards the west at speeds comparable to those measured in summer. However, the low-frequency current fluctuations over the shelf were much more energetic in winter. These subtidal current fluctuations were highly coherent horizontally and vertically over the shelf and with surface wind-stress fluctuations (which increased in magnitude by a factor of 5 over the summer period). The most energetic subtidal current events observed over the shelf also tended to extend into the upper slope region. The subtidal currents observed over the upper slope in summer were dominated by three bursts of large eastward currents which correspond to the passage of anticyclonic Gulf Stream warm-core rings near or through the moored army. The effect of these rings on the current field does not appear to penetrate shoreward of the shelf break. In winter only two rings passed near the array and their influence on the observed upper slope currents was unclear owing, in part, to the increased subtidal current variability caused by the stronger synoptic wind forcing in winter. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify possible annual variations in the NSFE79 moored current and temperature data. Significant annual variations were found in the temperature field over the shelf and upper slope and in the low-frequency current variability over the shelf. No significant annual variation was observed in the alongshelf current over the shelf, however, suggesting that there is, at least on time scales of one month and more, a continuous flow of shelf water into the Middle Atlantic Bight from the Georges Bank/Gulf of Maine region. The mean westward volume flux between the 40 and 120 m isobaths observed in NSFE79 was 38.3 ± 6.9 × 104 m3 s−1.},

Strong seasonal cycles are also found in the salinity and density fields at Cape Sable which appear to be controlled both by buoyancy input from the coastal current and local mixing effects. A linear diagnostic model indicates that the primary dynamical balance for the circulation is between a longshore pressure gradient and longshore mean density and stratification gradients which have summer maxima. Lesser contributions arise from longshore wind, offshore density gradient and centrifugal upwelling. Tidal rectification, deduced from coherent modulations of the semidiurnal tidal streams and low-frequency currents, supports the Browns Bank gyre circulation and drives both westward and offshore components of the near-bottom flow off Cape Sable. Thus the “centrifugal upwelling” hypothesis fails and the main driving force for Cape Sable upwelling appears to be the longshore density variations maintained by tidal mixing.},

	abstract = {Records of current, temperature and salinity from a two-year mooring program at the shelf break off Nova Scotia are examined to determine the low-frequency oceanic responses to the driving surface wind field and fluctuating offshore currents associated with the Gulf Stream. The seasonal mean and subtidal variance (at periods of 2–10 days) of the cross-shelf currents reflect the strong annual cycle in the wind field measured at Sable Island. The mean vertical shear suggests a simple Ekman response to winter increases in the longshore wind component, but this model fails quantitatively because 1) the inferred surface-layer (20 m) transport is much too large and 2) the deep (150 m) “return” flow shows no annual signal. The excessive offshore near-surface transport in winter must be reconciled with the relatively stationary position of the shelf/slope-water boundary (SSB) by invoking intense cross-frontal mixing and/or a seasonal mean alongshore pressure gradient. The seasonal mean longshore currents above the main thermocline appear to he more strongly influenced by energetic topographic Rossby waves than by wind. Weekly sea-surface temperature analyses are used to monitor off-shore forcing reflected by fluctuations in the position of the SSB in the region from 60 to 65°W. The dominant empirical mode of its space-time variance represents a uniform on–offshore translation at very low frequencies. The longshore current variance in the ocean-forced spectral band (periods 10–90 days) is 1) correlated with the low-frequency onshore displacement of the SSB in the deep water on the continental rise and 2) comparable to that in the wind-driven band (periods 2–10 days) from 50 to 150 m at the shelf break. On the shelf, the advective onshore transports of heat and salt exhibit annual cycles similar to those in the wind field, and generally exceed the vertically integrated eddy fluxes by factors of 2–4. However, the combination of observed moan and eddy transport supports excessive alongshore gradients of temperature and salinity in the context of a simple box model, and hence may not be representative of the entire shelf.},

The thermocline thickness increases in the offshore direction. Salinity presents seasonal variability due to river discharge and wind variations, with low-salinity waters spanning ∼100 km across the shelf from May to September in a ∼10 m thick surface layer. Stratification intensifies from April/May to late summer, especially within 80 km from the coast. The pycnocline deepens in the water column during late summer, while the passage of storms during fall rapidly reduces the stratification.

	abstract = {The alternative hypothesis that observed regions of recurrent hypoxia on the New Jersey inner shelf are more related to coastal upwelling than riverine inputs of nutrients was investigated through a series of multidisciplinary research programs beginning in 1993. The largest variations in ocean temperatures along the New Jersey coast, other than seasonal, are found to be caused by episodic summertime upwelling events driven by southwesterly winds associated with the atmospheric Bermuda High. Off the southern coast of New Jersey, topographic variations associated with ancient river deltas cause upwelled water to evolve into an alongshore line of recurrent upwelling centers that are colocated with historical regions of low dissolved oxygen. Recurrent upwelling centers are observed every summer in a 9-year data set. The most significant upwelling events occur in summers following colder than usual falls and winters. Size and duration of individual events are correlated and are found to depend on the wind forcing history that effects the inner side of the Middle Atlantic Cold Pool, the precipitation history that effects the strength of the Hudson River plume, and the mixing storm frequency. Upwelling results in a significant enhancement of particulate organic carbon. The typical carbon enhancement associated with the upwelling is sufficient to deplete 75\% of the oxygen in the bottom water, making it borderline hypoxic. This indicates that topographically controlled coastal upwelling, rather than riverine inputs, is the more probable mechanism for generating the historical regions of recurrent hypoxia observed along the New Jersey coast.},

Previous studies have concentrated on onshore intrusions of slope water. Here we present a direct intrusion of Gulf Stream warm-core ring water onto the shelf representing a previously unknown exchange process at the shelfbreak. Impingement of warm-core rings at the shelfbreak generates along-isobath intrusions that grow like Pinocchio's nose, extending hundreds of kilometers to the southwest. By combining satellite and Ocean Observatory Initiative Pioneer Array data and idealized numerical simulations, we discover that the intrusion results from topographically induced vorticity variation of the ring water, rather than from entrainment of the shelfbreak frontal jet. This intrusion of the Gulf Stream ring water has important biogeochemical implications and could facilitate migration of marine species across the shelfbreak barrier and transport low-nutrient surface Gulf Stream ring water to the otherwise productive shelfbreak region.},

Based on Akaike’s information criterion, both the cold pool and spawning stock biomass were important predictors of recruitment and led to annual variation in estimated biomass reference points and associated yield.

	abstract = {Discarding undesirable catch is recognized as a major problem confronting ﬁshery managers. It is widely perceived by managers, however, that reductions in discards can only be accomplished via reductions in good or desirable outputs and technical efﬁciency. Yet there appear to be few studies which actually examine the relationship between discard reduction and technical efﬁciency. In this paper, we present an alternative concept of technical efﬁciency, which explicitly recognizes that measures of technical efﬁciency should be adjusted for discard levels. This is because traditional measures of efﬁciency do not consider the resources used in order to discard. We also offer a framework based on data envelopment analysis for assessing efﬁciency in the presence of undesirable outputs. We examine the relationship between vessel efﬁciency and regulatory discards in the U.S. Georges Bank multi-species otter trawl ﬁshery on a tow-level basis. We then examine differences between efﬁcient and inefﬁcient tows, and extend our results to the trip level. Further examination of trip-level results then yield insights into the potential impact of trip-limit regulations. Results show that in order to reduce discards, vessels are limited in the amount they can increase their total output, and that trip-limit regulations may have unintended consequences.},

	abstract = {Recreational fisheries regulations frequently consist of possession limits, size limits, and seasonal closures that constrain the ability of recreational fishermen to catch or land fish. It is difficult to predict how these regulations will influence angler participation and recreational fishing mortality. This research integrates a utility-theory consistent model of demand for recreational fishing trips with an age-structured stock dynamics model to provide policy relevant advice to managers of the groundfish fishery in the Northeast United States. The recreational cod and haddock regulations implemented in 2014 have high costs in terms of foregone angler welfare and minimal positive impacts on stock conditions after three years. The ability of policies that generate large amounts of discarding, like high minimum size limits, to meet conservation objectives are also found to be quite sensitive to assumptions about the recreational discard mortality rate.},
