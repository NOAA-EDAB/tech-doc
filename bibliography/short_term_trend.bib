	abstract = {Trends in Canadian temperature and precipitation during the 20th century are analyzed using recently updated and adjusted station data. Six elements, maximum, minimum and mean temperatures along with diurnal temperature range (DTR), precipitation totals and ratio of snowfall to total precipitation are investigated. Anomalies from the 1961–1990 reference period were first obtained at individual stations, and were then used to generate gridded datasets for subsequent trend analyses. Trends were computed for 1900–1998 for southern Canada (south of 60°N), and separately for 1950–1998 for the entire country, due to insufficient data in the high arctic prior to the 1950s. From 1900–1998, the annual mean temperature has increased between 0.5 and 1.5°C in the south. The warming is greater in minimum temperature than in maximum temperature in the first half of the century, resulting in a decrease of DTR. The greatest warming occurred in the west, with statistically significant increases mostly seen during spring and summer periods. Annual precipitation has also increased from 5\% to 35\% in southern Canada over the same period. In general, the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation has been increasing due mostly to the increase in winter precipitation which generally falls as snow and an increase of ratio in autumn. Negative trends were identified in some southern regions during spring. From 1950–1998, the pattern of temperature change is distinct: warming in the south and west and cooling in the northeast, with similar magnitudes in both maximum and minimum temperatures. This pattern is mostly evident in winter and spring. Across Canada, precipitation has increased by 5\% to 35\%, with significant negative trends found in southern regions during winter. Overall, the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation has increased, with significant negative trends occurring mostly in southern Canada during spring. Indices of abnormal climate conditions are also examined. These indices were defined as areas of Canada for 1950–1998, or southern Canada for 1900–1998, with temperature or precipitation anomalies above the 66th or below the 34th percentiles in their relevant time series. These confirmed the above findings and showed that climate has been becoming gradually wetter and warmer in southern Canada throughout the entire century, and in all of Canada during the latter half of the century.},

	abstract = {One of the commonly used tools for detecting changes in climatic and hydrologic time series is trend analysis. A number of statistical tests exist to assess the significance of trends in time series. One of the commonly used non-parametric trend tests is the Mann-Kendall trend test. The null hypothesis in the Mann-Kendall test is that the data are independent and randomly ordered. However, the existence of positive autocorrelation in the data increases the probability of detecting trends when actually none exist, and vice versa. Although this is a well-known fact, few studies have addressed this issue, and autocorrelation in the data is often ignored. In this study, the effect of autocorrelation on the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic is discussed. A theoretical relationship is derived to calculate the variance of the Mann-Kendall test statistic for autocorrelated data. The special cases of AR(I) and MA(1) dependence are discussed as examples. An approximation to the theoretical relationship is also presented in order to reduce computation time for long time series. Based on the modified value of the variance of the Mann Kendall trend test statistic, a modified non-parametric trend test which is suitable for autocorrelated data is proposed. The accuracy of the modified test in terms of its empirical significance level was found to be superior to that of the original Mann-Kendall trend test without any loss of power. The modified test is applied to rainfall as well as streamflow data to demonstrate its performance as compared to the original Mann-Kendalltrend test. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Hydrometeorological data are commonly serially dependent and thereby deviate from the assumption of independence that underlies the Spearman rho trend test. The presence of autocorrelation will inﬂuence the signiﬁcance of observed trends. Speciﬁcally, the positive autocorrelation inﬂates Type I errors, while it deﬂates the power of trend detection in some cases. To address this issue, we derive a theoretical formula and recommend an appropriate empirical formula to calculate the rho variance of dependent series. The proposed procedure of the variance correction for the Spearman rho method is capable of mitigating the effect of autocorrelation on both, Type I error and power of the test. Similar to the Block Bootstrap method, it has the advantage that it does not require an initial knowledge of the autocorrelation structure or modiﬁcation of the series. In comparison, the capability of the Pre-Whitening method is sensitive to model misspeciﬁcation if the series are whitened by a parametric autocorrelation model. The Trend-Free Pre-Whitening method tends to lead to an overestimation of the statistical signiﬁcance of trends, similar to the original Spearman rho test. The results of the study emphasize the importance of selecting a reliable method for trend detection in serially dependent data.},

	abstract = {This study investigated using Monte Carlo simulation the interaction between a linear trend and a lag-one autoregressive (AR(1)) process when both exist in a time series. Simulation experiments demonstrated that the existence of serial correlation alters the variance of the estimate of the Mann–Kendall (MK) statistic; and the presence of a trend alters the estimate of the magnitude of serial correlation. Furthermore, it was shown that removal of a positive serial correlation component from time series by pre-whitening resulted in a reduction in the magnitude of the existing trend; and the removal of a trend component from a time series as a ﬁrst step prior to pre-whitening eliminates the inﬂuence of the trend on the serial correlation and does not seriously affect the estimate of the true AR(1). These results indicate that the commonly used pre-whitening procedure for eliminating the effect of serial correlation on the MK test leads to potentially inaccurate assessments of the signiﬁcance of a trend; and certain procedures will be more appropriate for eliminating the impact of serial correlation on the MK test. In essence, it was advocated that a trend ﬁrst be removed in a series prior to ascertaining the magnitude of serial correlation. This alternative approach and the previously existing approaches were employed to assess the signiﬁcance of a trend in serially correlated annual mean and annual minimum streamﬂow data of some pristine river basins in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that, with the previously existing procedures, researchers and practitioners may have incorrectly identiﬁed the possibility of signiﬁcant trends. Copyright  2002 Environment Canada.

For sample sizes of 10 to 50, I examined the performance of methods for adjusting confidence intervals of the mean and parameters of a linear regression for autocorrelation. Similar analyses are common in econometric studies, and serious concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the common adjustment approaches, especially for estimating the slope of a linear regression when the explanatory variable has a time trend. Use of a bias-corrected estimate of the autocorrelation, either in an adjusted t test or in a two-stage approach, outperformed other methods, including maximum likelihood and bootstrap estimators, in terms of confidence interval coverage. The bias correction was, however, sometimes awkward to apply. It was generally better to test for autocorrelation at the 0.5 level and use ordinary least squares if the test was not significant, although this pretesting mainly helped for weak autocorrelation and small sample sizes. For the best methods, the coverage was sometimes still substantially less than the stated 95\% when autocorrelation was strong, even for sample sizes as large as 50. This was true for estimates of the mean, the regression intercept, and, when the explanatory variable had a time trend, the slope. Simulation results and an example show that different adjustment methods can produce substantially different estimates and confidence intervals. Cautious interpretation of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests is recommended.},

Such data, however, typically show a positive serial correlation, which implies that a high/low observation tends to be followed by a high/low observation in the future. Such serial correlation among data is known to lead to deﬂation of p-values and related inﬂation of signiﬁcance levels of most statistical procedures and tests, making the obtained results unreliable. In particular, we show that the classical statistical approaches, e.g., Student’s t- and Mann–Kendall tests, which assume independence of data, are inappropriate when a serial correlation is present. To overcome the problem, we suggest sieve bootstrap approaches which take into account the serial correlation of data for trend tracking in order to obtain more accurate and reliable estimates. We compare and discuss the results on the classical and newly proposed statistical approaches for the trend analysis using freeze-up and break-up dates as well as ice cover observations from Lake Baikal for the period 1869–1996 and Lake Kallavesi freeze-up dates data from 1834 to 1996. Remarkably, some recent studies of the Kallavesi freeze-up and the Baikal break-up dates, performed under the assumption of independence, report p-values that are relatively close to the border of statistical signiﬁcance and, hence, provide some doubts in existence of a linear trend. In contrast, after taking into account the dependence structure of the observed data, the newly derived p-values have raised to an insigniﬁcant level, which implies no sufﬁcient evidence for existence of a linear trend. The new bootstrap-based approaches also yield substantially less signiﬁcant results for the existence of a trend for freeze-up dates and ice cover duration for Lake Baikal than reported earlier.},

            The identification of trends in ecosystem indicators has become a core component of ecosystem approaches to resource management, although oftentimes assumptions of statistical models are not properly accounted for in the reporting process. To explore the limitations of trend analysis of short times series, we applied three common methods of trend detection, including a generalized least squares model selection approach, the Mann–Kendall test, and Mann–Kendall test with trend-free pre-whitening to simulated time series of varying trend and autocorrelation strengths. Our results suggest that the ability to detect trends in time series is hampered by the influence of autocorrelated residuals in short series lengths. While it is known that tests designed to account for autocorrelation will approach nominal rejection rates as series lengths increase, the results of this study indicate biased rejection rates in the presence of even weak autocorrelation for series lengths often encountered in indicators developed for ecosystem-level reporting (N = 10, 20, 30). This work has broad implications for ecosystem-level reporting, where indicator time series are often limited in length, maintain a variety of error structures, and are typically assessed using a single statistical method applied uniformly across all time series.},
