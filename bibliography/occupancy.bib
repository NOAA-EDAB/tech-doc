Zooplankton abundance trends on Georges Bank, 1977–2004. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 909–919.Interannual trends in Georges Bank zooplankton abundance are described and related to variations in environmental variables for the period 1977–2004. Total zooplankton counts increased to above average levels in 1989 and stayed over or close to average through 2004. This analysis identified a group of taxa including Centropages typicus, Metridia lucens, and Temora longicornis that had similar interannual patterns of abundance. All these taxa increased sharply in the early 1990s and remained high through 2001. Some taxa declined sharply in 2002, others have continued elevated through 2004. Total zooplankton counts in the past two years were also boosted by a substantial increase in the abundance of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Evidence is presented that these changes may be related to variations in Scotian Shelf inflow, which freshened water on the Northeast US continental shelf, perhaps increasing both primary production and the influx of zooplankton into the region. There was a positive correlation between the biomass of pelagic predators and the abundance of several zooplankton taxa, suggesting that bottom-up processes and advective supply are the key factors that regulate the Georges Bank foodweb.},

abstract = {Kane, J. 2011. Multiyear variability of phytoplankton abundance in the Gulf of Maine. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1833-1841. Significant interannual changes in phytoplankton abundance were identified in the Continuous Plankton Recorder time-series collected in the Gulf of Maine from 1961 to 2008. Abundance levels of nearly all the common taxa began to increase in 1990 and remained elevated through 2001. During that period, total numbers were above average throughout the year, with an unusual bloom in late summer. Multivariate analysis of abundance identified three consecutive multiyear periods of varying abundance levels: low to average from 1961 to 1989, above average or very high from 1990 to 2001, and below average thereafter, through 2008. Phytoplankton abundance patterns were closely aligned to the rising trends displayed by several of the common zooplankton taxa. The North Atlantic Oscillation was the only environmental variable examined that showed some association with time-series abundance trends of plankton. The index was primarily positive in the 1990s, which would favour the propagation of warm, nutrient-rich slope water into the region. Perhaps the increased influx of this water, along with feedback enrichment from abundant zooplankton stocks and reduced top-down control by the relative scarcity of the dominant copepod Calanus finmarchicus, combined with a low salinity to make the 1990s a unique decade for plankton change in the Gulf of Maine.},

abstract = {We investigated regime shifts in seasonal zooplankton communities of the Northeast continental shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES) and its subcomponent ecoregions over a multi-decadal period (1977–2013). Our cross ecoregion analysis shows that regime shifts in different ecoregions often exhibited very distinct characteristics, emphasizing more granular fluctuations in NES plankton communities relative to previous work. Shifts early in the time series generally reflected an increase in abundance levels. The response of zooplankton abundance within fall communities was more similar among ecoregions than for spring communities. The Gulf of Maine exhibited highly distinct patterns from other ecoregions, with regime shifts identified in the early 1980s, early 2000s, and mid-2000s for spring communities. Regime shifts were identified in the early to mid-1990s for the NES, Georges Bank, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight ecoregions, while the fall communities experienced shifts in the early 1990s and late 1980s for the NES and Georges Bank, but in the late 1990s in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. A constrained correspondence analysis of zooplankton community against local and basin-scale climatological indices suggests that water temperature, stratification, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) were the predominant factors in driving the zooplankton community composition.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: There is accumulating evidence for decadal-scale regime shifts at the base of the food web on the Northeast US Continental Shelf. However, less evidence exists for regime shifts in fish recruitment success, particularly for synchronized regimes across multiple species. Here, we analyzed stock assessment output and survey data to test for regimes in the recruitment success of 18 commercially important marine species over a 29 yr timespan. We then tested whether recruitment regimes coincide with regimes in the zooplankton community, and whether the abundance of large spawners could explain the patterns in recruitment. We found evidence for 3 decadal-scale recruitment regimes: low recruitment success in the 1980s, high success in the 1990s, and a return to low recruitment success in the 2000s. This general pattern was found in all datasets of recruitment. The abundance of large spawners did not appear to be a broad-scale driver of recruitment success; however, recruitment regimes coincided with regimes in copepod abundance and size structure.},

@article{Sappington2007,
abstract = {Abstract: Terrain ruggedness is often an important variable in wildlife habitat models. Most methods used to quantify ruggedness are indices derived from measures of slope and, as a result, are strongly correlated with slope. Using a Geographic Information System, we developed a vector ruggedness measure (VRM) of terrain based on a geomorphological method for measuring vector dispersion that is less correlated with slope. We examined the relationship of VRM to slope and to 2 commonly used indices of ruggedness in 3 physiographically different mountain ranges within the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. We used VRM, slope, distance to water, and springtime bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) adult female locations to model sheep habitat in the 3 ranges. Using logistic regression, we determined that the importance of ruggedness in habitat selection remained consistent across mountain ranges, whereas the relative importance of slope varied according to the characteristic physiography of each range. Our results indicate that the VRM quantifies local variation in terrain more independently of slope than other methods tested, and that VRM and slope distinguish 2 different components of bighorn sheep habitat.},

@article{Friedman2012,
abstract = {This paper demonstrates how multi-scale measures of rugosity, slope and aspect can be derived from fine-scale bathymetric reconstructions created from geo-referenced stereo imagery. We generate three-dimensional reconstructions over large spatial scales using data collected by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), manned submersibles and diver-held imaging systems. We propose a new method for calculating rugosity in a Delaunay triangulated surface mesh by projecting areas onto the plane of best fit using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Slope and aspect can be calculated with very little extra effort, and fitting a plane serves to decouple rugosity from slope. We compare the results of the virtual terrain complexity calculations with experimental results using conventional in-situ measurement methods. We show that performing calculations over a digital terrain reconstruction is more flexible, robust and easily repeatable. In addition, the method is non-contact and provides much less environmental impact compared to traditional survey techniques. For diver-based surveys, the time underwater needed to collect rugosity data is significantly reduced and, being a technique based on images, it is possible to use robotic platforms that can operate beyond diver depths. Measurements can be calculated exhaustively at multiple scales for surveys with tens of thousands of images covering thousands of square metres. The technique is demonstrated on data gathered by a diver-rig and an AUV, on small single-transect surveys and on a larger, dense survey that covers over [Formula: see text]. Stereo images provide 3D structure as well as visual appearance, which could potentially feed into automated classification techniques. Our multi-scale rugosity, slope and aspect measures have already been adopted in a number of marine science studies. This paper presents a detailed description of the method and thoroughly validates it against traditional in-situ measurements.},

abstract = {The characteristics and benefits of ocean color merged data sets created using a semi-analytical model and the normalized water-leaving radiance observations from the SeaWiFS, MODIS-AQUA and MERIS ocean color missions are presented. Merged data products are coalesced from multiple mission observations into a single data product with better spatial and temporal coverage than the individual missions. Using the data from SeaWiFS, MODIS-AQUA and MERIS for the 2002–2009 time period, the average daily coverage of a merged product is ∼25{\%} of the world ocean which is nearly twice that of any single mission's observations. The frequency at which a particular area is sampled from space is also greatly improved in merged data as some areas can be sampled as frequently as 64{\%} of the time (in days). The merged data presented here are validated through matchup analyses and by comparing them to the data sets obtained from individual missions. Further, a complete error budget for the final merged data products was developed which accounts for uncertainty associated with input water-leaving radiances and provides uncertainty levels for the output products (i.e. the chlorophyll concentration, the combined dissolved and detrital absorption coefficient and the particulate backscattering coefficient). These merged products and their uncertainties at each pixel were developed within the NASA REASON/MEaSUREs and ESA GlobColour projects and are available to the scientific community. Our approach has many benefits for the creation of unified Climate Data Records from satellite ocean color observations.},

abstract = {A major objective of ecology is to understand how ecological processes limit population connectivity and species' distributions. By spatially quantifying ecological components driving functional connectivity, we can understand why some locally suitable habitats are unoccupied, resulting in observed discontinuities in distribution. However, estimating connectivity may be difficult due to population stochasticity and violations of assumptions of parametric statistics. To address these issues, we present a novel application of Random Forests to landscape genetic data. We address the effects of three key ecological components on Bufo boreas connectivity in Yellowstone National Park: ecological process, scale, and hierarchical organization. Habitat permeability, topographic morphology, and temperature-moisture regime are all significant ecological processes associated with B. boreas connectivity. Connectivity was influenced by growing-season precipitation, 1988 Yellowstone fires, cover, temperature, impervious surfaces (roads and development), and topographic complexity (56{\%} variation explained). We found that habitat permeability generally operates on fine scales, while topographic morphology and temperature-moisture regime operate across multiple scales, thus demonstrating the importance of cross-scale analysis for ecological interpretation. In a hierarchical analysis, we were able to explain more variation within genetic clusters as identified using Structure (a Bayesian algorithm) (74{\%}; dispersal cover, growing-season precipitation, impervious surfaces) as opposed to between genetic clusters (45{\%}; ridgelines, hot, dry slopes, length of hot season, and annual precipitation). Finally, the analytical methods we developed are powerful and can be applied to any species or system with appropriate landscape and genetic data.},
