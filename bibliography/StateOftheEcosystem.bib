	abstract = {Sampling during four summers over a twenty-seven year period has documented dense populations of Salpa aspera in the Slope Water south of New England, northeastern United States. The salps demonstrated a strong pattern of diel vertical migration, moving to depth (mostly 600–800m) during the day and aggregating in the epipelagic ({\textless}100m) at night. Filtration rates determined from both gut pigment analysis and direct feeding experiments indicated that both the aggregate and solitary stages filtered water at rates ranging from 0.5 to 6lh-1ml-1 biovolume. Maximum displacement volumes of salps measured were 5.7lm-2 in 1986 and 1.6lm-2 in 1993. Depending on the year, the sampled salp populations were calculated to clear between 8 and 74\% of the upper 50m during each 8h night. Total fecal output for the same populations was estimated to be between 5 and 91mgCm-2night-1. These results, and other observations, suggest this region is a salp “hot spot”, with swarms of S. aspera developing seasonally on a frequent basis.},

Here we provide evidence for a weakening of the AMOC by about 3 ± 1 sverdrups (around 15 per cent) since the mid-twentieth century. This weakening is revealed by a characteristic spatial and seasonal sea-surface temperature ‘fingerprint’—consisting of a pattern of cooling in the subpolar Atlantic Ocean and warming in the Gulf Stream region—and is calibrated through an ensemble of model simulations from the CMIP5 project. We find this fingerprint both in a high-resolution climate model in response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and in the temperature trends observed since the late nineteenth century. The pattern can be explained by a slowdown in the AMOC and reduced northward heat transport, as well as an associated northward shift of the Gulf Stream. Comparisons with recent direct measurements from the RAPID project and several other studies provide a consistent depiction of record-low AMOC values in recent years.},

The U.S. East Coast has 1.7 million acres of federal bottom under lease for the development of wind energy installations, with plans for more than 1,500 foundations to be placed. The scale of these wind farms has the potential to alter the unique and delicate oceanographic
conditions along the expansive Atlantic continental shelf, a region characterized by a strong seasonal thermocline that overlies cold bottom water, known as the “Cold Pool.” Strong seasonal stratification traps cold (typically less than 10°C) water above the ocean bottom sustaining
a boreal fauna that represents vast fisheries, including the most lucrative shellfish fisheries in the United States. This paper reviews the existing literature and research pertaining to the ways in which offshore wind farms may alter processes that establish, maintain, and degrade stratification
associated with the Cold Pool through vertical mixing in this seasonally dynamic system. Changes in stratification could have important consequences in Cold Pool setup and degradation, processes fundamental to high fishery productivity of the region. The potential for these multiple wind energy
arrays to alter oceanographic processes and the biological systems that rely on them is possible; however, a great deal of uncertainty remains about the nature and scale of these interactions. Research should be prioritized that identifies stratification thresholds of influence, below which
turbines and wind farm arrays may alter oceanographic processes. These should be examined within context of spatial and seasonal dynamics of the Cold Pool and offshore wind lease areas to identify potential areas of further study.},

	abstract = {There has been wide interest in Marine Heatwaves and their ecological consequences in recent years. Most analyses have focused on remotely sensed sea surface temperature data due to the temporal and spatial coverage it provides in order to establish the presence and duration of Heatwaves. Using hydrographic data from a variety of sources, we show that an advective Marine Heatwave was initiated by an event in late December of 2016 south of New England, with temperature anomalies measuring up to 6°C and salinity anomalies exceeding 1 PSU. Similar features were observed off of New Jersey in February 2017, and are associated with the Shelfbreak Front migrating from its normal position to mid-shelf or further onshore. Shelf water of 34 PSU was observed just north of Cape Hatteras at the 30 m isobath and across the continental shelf in late April 2017. These observations reveal that the 2017 Marine Heatwave was associated with a strong positive salinity anomaly, that its total duration was approximately 4 months, and its advective path extended roughly 850 km along the length of the continental shelf in the Middle Atlantic Bight. The southward advective velocity implied by the arrival north of Cape Hatteras is consistent with previous estimates of alongshelf velocity for the region. The origin of this Marine Heatwave is likely related to cross-shelf advection driven by the presence of a Warm Core Ring adjacent to the shelfbreak south of New England.},

	abstract = {Abstract Observations and high-resolution numerical modeling are used to investigate the dynamical processes related to the initiation of an advective Marine Heatwave in the Middle Atlantic Bight of the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf. Both the observations and the model identify two significant cross-shelf intrusions in November 2016 and January 2017, with the latter inducing large-magnitude water mass anomalies across the shelf. Model prognostic fields reveal the importance of the combination of cyclonic eddies or ringlets and upwelling-favorable winds in producing the large-distance cross-shelf penetration and temperature/salinity anomalies. The cyclonic eddies in close proximity to the shelfbreak set up local along-isobath pressure gradients and provide favorable conditions for the intensification of the shelfbreak front, both processes driving cross-isobath intrusions of warm, salty offshore water onto the outer continental shelf. Subsequently, strong and persistent upwelling-favorable winds drive a rapid, bottom intensified cross-shelf penetration in January 2017 composed of the anomalous water mass off the shelfbreak. The along-shelf settings including realistic representation of bathymetric features are essential in the characteristics of the cross-shelf penetration. The results highlight the importance of smaller scale cyclonic eddies and the intricacy of the interplay between multiple processes to drive significant cross-shelf events.},

It is maintained by northerly currents and can be traced back to Arctic water masses. The Cold Pool provides habitat for many boreal species at latitudes far south of their normal range and plays an important role in the population dynamics of lower and upper trophic level organisms. Here, we describe changes in the extent and thermal properties of the Cold Pool using both observations and models. Two indices are developed based on a gridded, interpolated bottom temperature dataset; the first is a mean temperature indicator, and the second is a spatial extent indicator. The temperature indicator showed a significant increasing trend over the study period 1968–2019 and a single change point in 2008. Similarly, the area indicator declined significantly, also displaying a change point in 2008. Cold Pool maximum temperature and minimum size were observed in 2017, which is also known as a heatwave year in the MAB. The indices presented here support the view of a rapidly warming Cold Pool that is being limited in its spatial extent. Changes in Cold Pool hydrography will likely affect boreal species distributions and total ecosystem productivity.},

The census documents formation and demise times and locations, and formation size for all 961 WCRs formed in the study period that live for a week or more. A clear regime shift was observed around the Year 2000 and was reported by a subset of authors (Gangopadhyay et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-48661-9). The WCR formation over the whole region (75–55°W) increased from an average of 18 per year during Regime 1 (1980–1999) to 33 per year during Regime 2 (2000–2017). For geographic analysis formation locations were grouped in four 5° zones between 75°W and 55°W. Seasonally, WCR formations show a significant summer maxima and winter minima, a pattern that is consistent through all zones and both temporal regimes. The lifespan and size distribution show progressively more rings with higher longevity and greater size when formed to the east of 70°W. The average lifespan of the WCRs in all four zones decreased by 20–40\% depending on zones and/or seasons from Regime 1 to Regime 2, while the size distribution remained unchanged across regimes. The ring footprint index, a first-order signature of impact of the WCRs on the slope, increased significantly (26–90\%) for all zones from Regime 1 to Regime 2, with the highest percent increase in Zone 2 (70–65°W). This observational study establishes critical statistical and dynamical benchmarks for validating numerical models and highlights the need for further dynamical understanding of the GS-ring formation processes.},

	abstract = {Fluctuations in the path of the Gulf Stream (GS) have been previously studied by primarily connecting to either the wind-driven subtropical gyre circulation or buoyancy forcing via the subpolar gyre. Here we present a statistical model for 1 year predictions of the GS path (represented by the GS northern wall—GSNW) between W and W incorporating both mechanisms in a combined framework. An existing model with multiple parameters including the previous year's GSNW index, center location, and amplitude of the Icelandic Low and the Southern Oscillation Index was augmented with basin-wide Ekman drift over the Azores High. The addition of the wind is supported by a validation of the simpler two-layer Parsons-Veronis model of GS separation over the last 40 years. A multivariate analysis was carried out to compare 1-year-in-advance forecast correlations from four different models. The optimal predictors of the best performing model include: (a) the GSNW index from the previous year, (b) gyre-scale integrated Ekman Drift over the past 2 years, and (c) longitude of the Icelandic Low center lagged by 3 years. The forecast correlation over the 27 years (1994–2020) is 0.65, an improvement from the previous multi-parameter model's forecast correlation of 0.52. The improvement is attributed to the addition of the wind-drift component. The sensitivity of forecasting the GS path after extreme atmospheric years is quantified. Results indicate the possibility of better understanding and enhanced predictability of the dominant wind-driven variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and of fisheries management models that use the GS path as a metric.},

We present evidence that this ring formation behavior has been asymmetric over both interannual and seasonal time-scales. After a previously reported regime-shift in 2000, 15 more Warm Core Rings have been forming yearly compared to 1980–1999. In contrast, there have been no changes in the annual formation rate of the Cold Core Rings. This increase in Warm Core Ring production leads to an excess heat transfer of 0.10 PW to the Slope Sea, amounting to 7.7–12.4\% of the total Gulf Stream heat transport, or 5.4–7.3\% of the global oceanic heat budget at \$\$30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}hbox \{N\}\$\$. Seasonally, more Cold Core Rings are produced in the winter and spring and more Warm Core Rings are produced in the summer and fall leading to more summertime heat transfer to the north of the Stream. The seasonal cycle of relative ring formation numbers is strongly correlated (r = 0.82) with that of the difference in upper layer temperatures between the Sargasso and Slope seas. This quantification motivates future efforts to understand the recent increasing influence of the Gulf Stream on the circulation and ecosystem in the western North Atlantic.},

In 2009-2010, abrupt warming prompted an ecosystem shift with consequences for fisheries, yet the cause of this event is unclear. Here we use satellite altimetry and in situ measurements to show that, in 2008, the Gulf Stream migrated closer to the Tail of the Grand Banks, a shift that has persisted ever since. This change reduced the westward connectivity of the Labrador Current that otherwise supplies cold, fresh, oxygen-rich waters to the shelf. Within one year after the appearance of anomalously warm and saline water at the Tail of Grand Banks, subsurface warming progressed south-westwards. Historical observations suggest a similar sequence of events may have occurred in the 1970s. Therefore, monitoring water properties at the Tail of Grand Banks may offer predictability for shelf properties and ecosystem perturbations with substantial lead time.},

	abstract = {The Northeast U.S. shelf (NES) is an oceanographically dynamic marine ecosystem and supports some of the most valuable demersal fisheries in the world. A reliable prediction of NES environmental variables, particularly ocean bottom temperature, could lead to a significant improvement in demersal fisheries management. However, the current generation of climate model-based seasonal-to-interannual predictions exhibits limited prediction skill in this continental shelf environment. Here, we have developed a hierarchy of statistical seasonal predictions for NES bottom temperatures using an eddy-resolving ocean reanalysis data set. A simple, damped local persistence prediction model produces significant skill for lead times up to ∼5 months in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and up to ∼10 months in the Gulf of Maine, although the prediction skill varies notably by season. Considering temperature from a nearby or upstream (i.e., more poleward) region as an additional predictor generally improves prediction skill, presumably as a result of advective processes. Large-scale atmospheric and oceanic indices, such as Gulf Stream path indices (GSIs) and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index, are also tested as predictors for NES bottom temperatures. Only the GSI constructed from temperature observed at 200 m depth significantly improves the prediction skill relative to local persistence. However, the prediction skill from this GSI is not larger than that gained using models incorporating nearby or upstream shelf/slope temperatures. Based on these results, a simplified statistical model has been developed, which can be tailored to fisheries management for the NES.},

A particularly useful method of characterizing the flow of energy through an ecosystem and the subsequent direct and indirect implications of management actions is mass balance modeling. Here we outline the equations as utilized in Rpath, an R implementation of the mass balance algorithms popularized by Ecopath with Ecosim that are designed to work with fisheries data sources. We believe that common practices in R will aid in the reproducibility of conducting analysis using a mass balance model as all of the code is contained within a single script file. This includes the built-in statistical and graphical functions of R. In addition to added reproducibility, R is a coding language with which ecologists are familiar. This familiarity offers greater flexibility for practitioners to tailor the model to their needs. We have made the code available on an open software development platform which should aid in continuous community development of the tool.},

By embracing open science, in which scientific data, methods, and products are made publicly accessible, along with the ever-expanding tools facilitating open science, IEA practitioners will be better equipped to address these challenges. Here, we provide a snapshot of the state of open science practices in IEAs on-going across the United States. We show that open science has improved the flexibility, reproducibility, and efficiency of the scientific workflows within the IEA framework. Although the initial time investment necessary for developing open science workflows may appear daunting, we show that the subsequent returns provided by the efficient and transparent development of IEA products are worth the effort.

	abstract = {Resource managers worldwide are being asked to consider the ecosystem while making management decisions. Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) provides a flexible framework for addressing ecosystem considerations in decision making. The US Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) adapted the IEA approach and implemented a structured decision framework to address species, fleet, habitat, and climate interactions as part of their Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) in 2016. The Council’s EAFM decision framework first uses risk assessment to prioritize fishery-ecosystem interactions for consideration. The Council’s 2017 EAFM risk assessment identified a range of ecological, social, and management objectives or risk elements. Development of a conceptual model to identify key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery is the second step in the framework. The Council identified summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) as a high-risk fishery and finalized an EAFM conceptual model that considers high-risk factors and ecosystem elements in 2019. The Council used the conceptual model to identify three priority summer flounder management questions (recreational data uncertainty, recreational discards, and distribution shifts) to be considered for quantitative management strategy evaluation, the third step in the EAFM framework and set to begin in 2020. Finally, as strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or other priorities identified in the risk assessment can be addressed. The Council’s rapid progress in implementing EAFM resulted from an extensive, positive, and collaborative process between managers, stakeholders, and scientists. Collaboration helps build trust and buy-in from all participants and is essential to IEA and to the success of EAFM.},

	abstract = {Fishery managers worldwide are evaluating methods for incorporating climate, habitat, ecological, social, and economic factors into current operations in order to implement Ecosystem Approaches to Fishery Management (EAFM). While this can seem overwhelming, it is possible to take practical steps towards EAFM implementation that make use of existing information and provide managers with valuable strategic advice. Here, we describe the process used by the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) to develop an ecosystem-level risk assessment, the initial step proposed in their recently adopted EAFM guidance document. The Council first defined five types of Risk Elements (ecological, economic, social, food production, management) and identified which management objectives aligned with each element. Based on an existing ecosystem status report for the region and other existing sources (including expert opinion), potential ecological, social, economic, and management indicators were identified for each risk element. Finally, low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high risk criteria were defined for each indicator, and the indicator data were used to score each risk element using the criteria. The ultimate outcome is a ranked risk assessment in order to focus on the highest risk issues for further evaluation and mitigation. The risk assessment highlights certain species and certain management issues as posing higher cumulative risks to meeting Council management objectives when considering a broad range of ecological, social, and economic factors. Tabular color coded summaries of risk assessment results will be used by the Council to prioritize further EAFM analyses as well as research plans over the coming five years. As ecosystem reporting and operational EAFM continue to evolve in future years, the Council foresees integrating these efforts so that ecosystem indicators are refined to meet the needs of fishery managers in identifying and managing risks to achieving ecological, social, and economic fishery objectives. Overall, ecosystem indicator-based risk assessment is a method that can be adapted to a wide range of resource management systems and available information, and therefore represent a promising way forward in the implementation of EAFM.},

	abstract = {The Cold Pool is a 20–60 m thick band of cold, near-bottom water that persists from spring to fall over the midshelf and outer shelf of the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) and Southern Flank of Georges Bank. The Cold Pool is remnant winter water bounded above by the seasonal thermocline and offshore by warmer slope water. Historical temperature profiles are used to characterize the average annual evolution and spatial structure of the Cold Pool. The Cold Pool gradually warms from spring to summer at a rate of order 1°C month−1. The warming rate is faster in shallower water where the Cold Pool is thinner, consistent with a vertical turbulent heat flux from the thermocline to the Cold Pool. The Cold Pool warming rate also varies along the shelf; it is larger over Georges Bank and smaller in the southern MAB. The mean turbulent diffusivities at the top of the Cold Pool, estimated from the spring to summer mean heat balance, are an order of magnitude larger over Georges Bank than in the southern MAB, consistent with much stronger tidal mixing over Georges Bank than in the southern MAB. The stronger tidal mixing causes the Cold Pool to warm more rapidly over Georges Bank and the eastern New England shelf than in the New York Bight or southern MAB. Consequently, the coldest Cold Pool water is located in the New York Bight from late spring to summer.},

	abstract = {Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) is an effective tool to gauge the relative performance of fishery management options. For the most part, MSEs have been applied to single-species management procedures. However, to be more inclusive of all the biological and technical interactions occurring within a system, ecosystem-based strategies are emerging. In order to test the feasibility of these strategies, a full ecosystem model should be used as an operating model. Mass balance food web models include many features that managers are interested in and therefore can be useful as an operating model. Until recently, full feedback interactions between a management strategy and a mass balance operating model were impractical. However, with the development of Rpath, users now have the ability to fully customize their mass balance models. We developed new functionality for the Rpath modelling framework that allows it to be used as a flexible operating model. Using an example Georges Bank model, we demonstrate how Rpath can now pause the simulation, evaluate an external model, and use the results to modify the parameters of the operating model. This new flexibility will allow users to test a variety of management strategies or couple to other models making Rpath a valuable tool for conducting MSEs.},

	abstract = {Evaluations of the conservation status of the endangered North Atlantic right whale as well as many other wildlife species often rely extensively on counts and cause-of-death determinations of carcasses found accidentally or during dedicated surveys. Even when survey effort dedicated to a population is extensive, many deaths may go unseen. We used an abundance estimation model to derive estimates of cryptic mortality for North Atlantic right whales and found that observed carcasses accounted for only 36\% of all estimated death during 1990–2017. We found strong evidence that total mortality varied over time, and that observed carcass counts were poor predictors of estimated annual numbers of whales dying. Importantly, there were substantial differences between fractions of deaths determined to be entanglement related during necropsy (49\%) and the fraction of cryptic deaths suffering serious injuries related to entanglement (87\%). Although we concluded that a single year's observations produced poor estimates of carcass detection rates due to the volatility of ratios of small counts, ratio estimates of data pooled over periods of consistent survey may offer better information on detection rates. Additionally, it appears unwise to consider cause of death determinations from detected carcasses as representative of cause-specific mortality rates in right whales given the large number of seriously injured whales from entanglement that are likely part of the unseen mortality.},

Historically, productive coastal oceans lack vertically resolved high-resolution carbonate system measurements on time scales relevant to organism ecology and life history. The recent development of a deep ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET)-based pH sensor system integrated into a Slocum glider has provided a platform for achieving high-resolution carbonate system profiles. From May 2018 to November 2019, seasonal deployments of the pH glider were conducted in the central Mid-Atlantic Bight. Simultaneous measurements from the glider's pH and salinity sensors enabled the derivation of total alkalinity and calculation of other carbonate system parameters including aragonite saturation state. Carbonate system parameters were then mapped against other variables, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll, over space and time. The seasonal dynamics of carbonate chemistry presented here provide a baseline to begin identifying drivers of acidification in this vital economic zone.},

	abstract = {1. The methods of analysing length-weight data from fish are reviewed. Emphasis is laid on empirical formulae of the type W = aLn, and the limitations of the conventional condition factor. 2. The length-weight relationship of perch of all sizes was determined from a series of regressions of log weight on log length, and an analysis of covariance. Relative condition factors were calculated for individual fish from smoothed mean weights obtained from the regression lines. 3. In length-weight relationship it was found that the perch could be divided into a series of six groups corresponding with age, sex and maturity. Each group was generally homogeneous within itself throughout the seasons, but usually differed significantly from the other groups. Relative condition was found to vary significantly with the season. 4. At any one season the gonad weight is a constant percentage of the body weight for fish of all sizes. The seasonal changes in gonad weight are described and differ somewhat for the two sexes. Stomach contents weigh up to 2\% of the body weight in summer. 5. There is a regular seasonal cycle in condition which is at its maximum in September and minimum in early spring. The different seasonal changes in condition between mature and immature fish can largely be accounted for by the cycle in gonad weight of the former.},

A 2×2×2 factorial experimental design was used to test for the effects of temperature (3°C, 5°C), salinity (10, 25), and sediment (sediment, no sediment) on the survival of juvenile crabs (14-68-mm carapace width) of both hatchery and wild origin. The presence of sediment did not significantly alter crab survival, while hatchery-raised crabs experienced significantly lower survivorship than wild-caught crabs. An accelerated failure time model fit to the survival data indicated that time to death increased significantly with increasing temperature, salinity, and crab size. These results suggest that winter survival varies with winter severity, is spatially dynamic, and that small juveniles are more at risk of dying over the winter than larger juveniles.},

	abstract = {The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is an important ecological and commercial species along the Eastern Seaboard of North America, although its abundance in Chesapeake Bay (Maryland and Virginia) has declined precipitously since the mid-1800s. Management activities, including efforts to enhance larval settlement, to rebuild the Chesapeake Bay eastern oyster population have met with limited success. Since 1939, juvenile oyster abundance has been measured at oyster bars in the northern portion of Chesapeake Bay. Prior analyses of those data indicate that juvenile oyster abundance is influenced by environmental conditions, which are related to regional climate. We quantified a regional scale (1,000 km2) climate signal using a synoptic climatology approach by identifying predominant weather patterns. We related these weather patterns to Susquehanna River freshwater discharge, a major influencing factor on Chesapeake Bay salinity, and the Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI), an indicator of the overall wetness or dryness of a given region. We developed path analysis models that linked weather patterns to Susquehanna River discharge and thence to either the PHDI or ambient salinity and water temperature and finally to juvenile oyster abundance in one of four preidentified spatial groupings. The path models indicated that weather patterns that produce wet conditions, leading to a higher PHDI and lower salinity, resulted in reduced juvenile oyster abundance; weather patterns that produce dry conditions that decreased the PHDI and increased salinity resulted in higher juvenile oyster abundance. Our results indicate that regions of higher juvenile oyster abundance may be predicted several months in advance using the path model. These predictions can be used to increase the effectiveness of oyster restoration efforts by indicating where hard substrate added to oyster bars in the four regions is likely to result in greater than average numbers of juvenile oysters.Received January 16, 2013; accepted July 24, 2013Published online December 3, 2013},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Causes of recruitment variability in young-of-the-year (YOY) striped bass Morone saxatilis from Chesapeake Bay were investigated based on (1) surveys from 2001 to 2003 to document spatio-temporal variability in abundance of larval striped bass, zooplankton prey, and feeding success of larvae; (2) a synthetic analysis (1996, 1998, 1999, 2001 to 2003) to describe how environmental factors and prey affect recruitment success; and (3) a 10 yr analysis (1993 to 2002) of inter-annual differences in spatial and temporal patterns of copepods and cladocera eaten by striped bass larvae. Striped bass YOY recruitment levels varied {\textgreater}11-fold in the 6 years examined. In those years, mean daily freshwater flows from the Susquehanna River to the bay in March and April varied {\textgreater}2-fold and controlled distribution and apparent survival of striped bass larvae. Strong recruitments of YOY striped bass were associated with matches in space and time of larval striped bass and high concentrations of zooplankton prey, especially the copepod Eurytemora affinis and cladoceran Bosmina longirostris. The strongest year classes (1996, 2003) were produced in years of high freshwater flow, characterized by a high abundance of feeding-stage larvae and a spatio-temporal match between peak abundance of larvae and zooplankton prey. Enhanced feeding opportunities were most pronounced in high freshwater-flow years (1996, 1998, 2003), when larvae and zooplankton prey were strongly associated with, and apparently retained near, the estuarine turbidity maximum. First-feeding larvae fed more successfully in a high-flow year (2003; prey incidence 91\%) than in a drier year (2001; prey incidence 35\%). A regression model that may have forecasting potential was developed to describe recruitment of YOY striped bass for the years from 1985 to 2006. The model includes spring freshwater flow and air temperatures to predict age-0 striped bass recruitment strength (R² = 0.65). Flow and temperature control environmental and hydrographic conditions that strongly influence spatio-temporal overlap of larval striped bass and zooplankton. The model provided accurate recruitment forecasts for 2007 and 2009, but was less successful in 2008, a year of exceptionally low recruitment.},

We examined the distribution of Zostera marina (eelgrass) dominated beds in the York River, Chesapeake Bay, VA over an 8-year time period. Using a temperature-dependent light model, declines in upriver areas were associated with higher light attenuation, resulting in lower light availability relative to compensating light requirements of Z. marina compared with downriver areas. An inverse relationship was observed between SAV growth and temperature with a change between net bed cover increases and decreases for the period of 2004-2011 observed at approximately 23 °C. Z. marina-dominated beds in the lower river have been recovering from a die-off event in 2005 and experienced another near complete decline in 2010, losing an average of 97 \% of coverage of Z. marina from June to October. These 2010 declines were attributed to an early summer heat event in which daily mean water temperatures increased from 25 to 30 °C over a 2-week time period, considerably higher than previous years when complete die-offs were not observed. Z. marina recovery from this event was minimal, while Ruppia maritima (widgeongrass) expanded its abundance. Water temperatures are projected to continue to increase in the Chesapeake Bay and elsewhere. These results suggest that short-term exposures to rapidly increasing temperatures by 4—5 °C above normal during summer months can result in widespread diebacks that may lead to Z. marina extirpation from historically vegetated areas, with the potential replacement by other species.},

	abstract = {Transport to and retention of early-life history stages within the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) region may be an important component of recruitment success of the anadromous striped bass Morone saxatilis and the white perch M. americana. This hypothesis was evaluated with spatially resolved surveys of the physical and biological characteristics of the upper Chesapeake Bay estuary during 5 cruises, 3 in May 1998 and 2 in May 1999. Gradients in depth-specific patterns of larval abundance and zooplankton prey were evaluated with respect to salinity, temperature and total suspended solids (TSS). Although physical conditions in the upper estuary differed between cruises and years, the spatial patterns in distribution of larvae and potential prey were consistent and tracked changes in salt front and ETM locations. A statistical analysis suggested that location relative to the ETM explained a significant amount of variability in concentrations of eggs, yolk-sac larvae, and larval prey, and that prey concentrations accounted for a significant amount of variability in concentrations of feeding larvae. Transport to the ETM region probably occurs during the egg (striped bass) and yolk-sac larva (white perch) stages and results in retention of early-stage feeding larvae in a zone of high prey concentrations. Physical conditions in the ETM region differed markedly between a low freshwater-flow year (1999) and a high flow year (1998), and abundances of striped bass and white perch post-yolk-sac larvae were significantly lower in 1999. Recruitment variability was poorly correlated with spawning stock biomass, but spawner-recruitment models that incorporated spring freshwater discharge explained an additional 41\% (striped bass) and 30\% (white perch) of the variability in recruitment. Annual changes in freshwater flow could control larval survival and recruitment by modifying the physical and biological characteristics of the ETM region.},

In Chesapeake Bay, strong juvenile recruitment of striped bass can occur when larvae overlap with high concentrations of their zooplankton prey, but the mechanisms fostering the temporal overlap are unknown. Here, the influence of winter temperature on the peak abundances of a key prey, Eurytemora carolleeae, was estimated with a temperature-dependent developmental model. The role of these peaks in regulating striped bass recruitment was explored in three nursery areas: upper Chesapeake Bay, Choptank River, and Patuxent River. Model results indicated that cold winters delay the timing and increase the size of peak E. carolleeae spring abundance. When the model output was used in regression relationships with striped bass juvenile recruitment and freshwater discharge, the regression models explained up to 78\% of annual recruitment variability. Results suggests that cold, wet winters could increase the chance of a match between striped bass larvae and high concentrations of their prey. This mechanistic link between winter temperatures and striped bass production, acting through prey dynamics, could further understanding of fish recruitment variability and indicates that warmer winters could negatively affect some striped bass populations.},

	abstract = {Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) form one of the most important and largest commercial fisheries in Chesapeake Bay. Blue crabs have evolutionary origins in the tropics, although they currently inhabit temperature estuaries that exhibit major fluctuations in diurnal, monthly, and seasonal environmental conditions. Therefore, harsh winter conditions in Chesapeake Bay are a potentially important source of blue crab stock loss. However, this variable has been largely unexamined. To assess the effects of variation in winter environmental conditions on blue crab survival, we measured winter morality of crabs in the field and conducted laboratory experiments to test the interactive effects of low temperature, salinity, and blue crab life stage. Field studies indicated that blue crabs suffered relatively low winter morality rates (≤3\%) during five out of eight winters, when bottom water temperature in February was at or above the 8-year average (3.4 °C). However, in years when bottom water temperature fell below the February average, annual mortality rates rose to 6.0–14.5\%. Mortality rates were highest in the coldest regions of Chesapeake Bay, and larger crabs and female crabs were most vulnerable to these stressful conditions. Similarly, in the laboratory, mortality was highest in the lowest temperature (1 °C) and salinity (8 ppt) treatments. Mature females were more sensitive to winter conditions than juvenile crabs. Of the juvenile life stages, recruits ({\textless}15 mm carapace width) were least tolerant to winter conditions. These results indicate that temperature, salinity, and blue crab life stage are important variables in predicting survivorship over winter months. Because winter mortality may be a significant source of stock loss for blue crabs, especially during severe winters and in low salinity areas of Chesapeake Bay, these predictions can be used to improve management estimates of stock size prior to each summer fishing season.},

We measured growth and elongation potential of wild celery and hydrilla propagules under various temperature and irradiance conditions to compare these two species and in part explain the stable persistence of wild celery and the variability in hydrilla coverage. A plant growth experiment was conducted to simulate actual temperatures in the Potomac River during spring of 1986 (plant coverage increased) and 1989 (plant coverage decreased). In the 1989 temperature treatment, ﬁnal heights of hydrilla and wild celery were unaffected by a 6-C decrease in temperature 2 weeks following tuber germination. Heights of wild celery, however, were more than twice that of hydrilla, and elongation rates of wild celery were greater than those of hydrilla when temperatures reached 17 to 22C. Laboratory studies conducted in complete darkness showed that wild celery tubers germinate at 13C, whereas hydrilla tubers germinate at 15C, and that wild celery elongated to heights twice those of hydrilla. Heights were positively correlated to tuber length. If irradiance is diminished at incipience, differences in tuber reserves and elongation potential may be sufﬁcient to ensure that wild celery can survive when hydrilla is not successful.},

            Gray seals were historically distributed along the northeastern coast of the United States, but bounties and lack of protection reduced numbers and they were rarely observed for most of the 20th century. Once protections were enacted, the population started to rebound. Here, we describe the recolonization and recovery of gray seals in the United States, focusing on the re-establishment of pupping sites. We fit individual generalized linear models to various time series (1988–2019) to estimate rates of increase in observed pup counts at four of the more data-rich sites. Annual rate of increase at individual sites ranged from −0.2\% (95\% CI: −2.3–1.9\%) to 26.3\% (95\% CI: 21.6–31.4\%). The increase in sites and number of pups born in the United States is driven by population growth and immigration from Canadian colonies and is part of a larger recovery of the Northwest Atlantic population. Wildlife protection, a healthy source population, habitat availability, and species traits that allow for dispersal and high productivity were all important factors in this recovery.},

In the high ρCO2 treatment, clearance rate decreased and excretion rate increased relative to the low ρCO2 treatment, resulting in reduced SFG. Moreover, oxygen:nitrogen (O:N) excretion ratio dropped, suggesting that a switch in metabolic strategy occurred. The medium ρCO2 treatment had no significant effects upon SFG; however, metabolic loss increased, suggesting a rise in energy expenditure. In addition, a significant increase in food selection efficiency was observed in the medium treatment, which could be a compensatory reaction to the metabolic over-costs.

	abstract = {Marine organisms are exposed to increasingly acidic oceans, as a result of equilibration of surface ocean water with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In this study, we examined the physiological response of Mytilus edulis from the Baltic Sea, grown for 2 months at 4 seawater pCO2 levels (39, 113, 243 and 405 Pa/385, 1,120, 2,400 and 4,000 μatm). Shell and somatic growth, calcification, oxygen consumption and \$\$ \{{\textbackslash}text\{NH\}\}\_\{4\}{\textasciicircum}\{ + \} \$\$excretion rates were measured in order to test the hypothesis whether exposure to elevated seawater pCO2 is causally related to metabolic depression. During the experimental period, mussel shell mass and shell-free dry mass (SFDM) increased at least by a factor of two and three, respectively. However, shell length and shell mass growth decreased linearly with increasing pCO2 by 6–20 and 10–34\%, while SFDM growth was not significantly affected by hypercapnia. We observed a parabolic change in routine metabolic rates with increasing pCO2 and the highest rates (+60\%) at 243 Pa. \$\$ \{{\textbackslash}text\{NH\}\}\_\{4\}{\textasciicircum}\{ + \} \$\$excretion rose linearly with increasing pCO2. Decreased O:N ratios at the highest seawater pCO2 indicate enhanced protein metabolism which may contribute to intracellular pH regulation. We suggest that reduced shell growth under severe acidification is not caused by (global) metabolic depression but is potentially due to synergistic effects of increased cellular energy demand and nitrogen loss.},

	abstract = {Climate change with increasing temperature and ocean acidification (OA) poses risks for marine ecosystems. According to Pörtner and Farrell [1], synergistic effects of elevated temperature and CO2-induced OA on energy metabolism will narrow the thermal tolerance window of marine ectothermal animals. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of an acute temperature rise on energy metabolism of the oyster, Crassostrea gigas chronically exposed to elevated CO2 levels (partial pressure of CO2 in the seawater {\textasciitilde}0.15 kPa, seawater pH {\textasciitilde} 7.7). Within one month of incubation at elevated PCO2 and 15 °C hemolymph pH fell (pHe = 7.1 ± 0.2 (CO2-group) vs. 7.6 ± 0.1 (control)) and PeCO2 values in hemolymph increased (0.5 ± 0.2 kPa (CO2-group) vs. 0.2 ± 0.04 kPa (control)). Slightly but significantly elevated bicarbonate concentrations in the hemolymph of CO2-incubated oysters ([HCO-3]e = 1.8 ± 0.3 mM (CO2-group) vs. 1.3 ± 0.1 mM (control)) indicate only minimal regulation of extracellular acid-base status. At the acclimation temperature of 15 °C the OA-induced decrease in pHe did not lead to metabolic depression in oysters as standard metabolism rates (SMR) of CO2-exposed oysters were similar to controls. Upon acute warming SMR rose in both groups, but displayed a stronger increase in the CO2-incubated group. Investigation in isolated gill cells revealed a similar temperature-dependence of respiration between groups. Furthermore, the fraction of cellular energy demand for ion regulation via Na+/K+-ATPase was not affected by chronic hypercapnia or temperature. Metabolic profiling using 1H-NMR spectroscopy revealed substantial changes in some tissues following OA exposure at 15 °C. In mantle tissue alanine and ATP levels decreased significantly whereas an increase in succinate levels was observed in gill tissue. These findings suggest shifts in metabolic pathways following OA-exposure. Our study confirms that OA affects energy metabolism in oysters and suggests that climate change may affect populations of sessile coastal invertebrates such as mollusks.},

We evaluate the importance of benthic habitats as space for shelter, feeding, and breeding by coastal fishes and motile invertebrates in four biogeographic regions of the eastern United States. The importance of different habitats changed with latitude. Soft sediments and riverine systems scored higher in northern regions, and marshes and coral reefs scored higher in the south. The importance of soft sediments is notable because environmental assessments often assume their ecological value is lower. Submerged aquatic vegetation was a key nursery habitat coast-wide. An important consideration is that anthropogenic impacts have altered habitat availability and use, and climate change is causing ongoing disturbance. Furthermore, distinct habitats should not be managed in isolation but rather as interconnected mosaics. Our approach, combined with information on status, vulnerability, and other ecological functions, can be used to evaluate trade-offs and develop habitat-management strategies.},

	abstract = {The oceans are changing more rapidly than ever before. Unprecedented climatic variability is interacting with unmistakable long-term trends, all against a backdrop of intensifying human activities. What remains unclear, however, is how to evaluate whether conditions have changed sufficiently to provoke major responses of species, habitats, and communities. We developed a framework based on multimodel inference to define ecosystem-based thresholds for human and environmental pressures in the California Current marine ecosystem. To demonstrate how to apply the framework, we explored two decades of data using gradient forest and generalized additive model analyses, screening for nonlinearities and potential threshold responses of ecosystem states (n = 9) across environmental (n = 6) and human (n = 10) pressures. These analyses identified the existence of threshold responses of five ecosystem states to four environmental and two human pressures. Both methods agreed on threshold relationships in two cases: (1) the winter copepod anomaly and habitat modification, and (2) sea lion pup production and the summer mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Considered collectively, however, these alternative analytical approaches imply that as many as five of the nine ecosystem states may exhibit threshold changes in response to negative PDO values in the summer (copepods, scavengers, groundfish, and marine mammals). This result is consistent with the idea that the influence of the PDO extends across multiple trophic levels, but extends current knowledge by defining the nonlinear nature of these responses. This research provides a new way to interpret changes in the intensities of human and environmental pressures as they relate to the ecological integrity of the California Current ecosystem. These insights can be used to make more informed assessments of when and under what conditions intervention, preparation, and mitigation may enhance progress toward ecosystem-based management goals.},

The results herein suggest that the path of this boundary current and the formation of the northern recirculation gyre are sensitive to both the magnitude of lateral viscosity and the strength of the deep western boundary current (DWBC). In particular, it is shown that bottom vortex stretching induced by a downslope DWBC near the south of the Grand Banks leads to the formation of a cyclonic northern recirculation gyre and keeps the path of the depth-integrated western boundary current downstream of Cape Hatteras separated from the North American coast. Both south of the Grand Banks and at the crossover region of the DWBC and Gulf Stream, the downslope DWBC induces strong bottom downwelling over the steep continental slope, and the magnitude of the bottom downwelling is locally stronger than surface Ekman pumping velocity, providing strong positive vorticity through bottom vortex-stretching effects. The bottom vortex-stretching effect is also present in an extensive area in the North Atlantic, and the contribution to the North Atlantic subpolar and subtropical gyres is on the same order as the local surface wind stress curl. Analytic solutions show that the bottom vortex stretching is important near the western boundary only when the continental slope is wider than the Munk frictional layer scale.},

Latitudinal variation in long term trends and seasonal patterns for the two copepod species were examined for four sub-regions: the Gulf of Maine (GOM), Georges Bank (GB), Southern New England (SNE), and Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB). Results suggested that there was significant difference in long term variation between northern region (GOM and GB), and the MAB for both species. C. finmarchicus generally peaked in May – June throughout the entire study region and Cen. typicus had a more complex seasonal pattern. Time series analysis revealed that the peak time for Cen. typicus switched from November – December to January - March after 1985 in the MAB. The long term abundance of C. finmarchicus showed more fluctuation in the MAB than the GOM and GB, whereas the long term abundance of Cen. typicus was more variable in the GB than other sub-regions. Alongshore transport was significantly correlated with the abundance of C. finmarchicus, i.e., more water from north, higher abundance for C. finmarchicus. The abundance of Cen. typicus showed positive relationship with the Gulf Stream north wall index (GSNWI) in the GOM and GB, but the GSNWI only explained 12–15\% of variation in Cen. typicus abundance. In general, the alongshore current was negatively correlated with the GSNWI, suggesting that Cen. typicus is more abundant when advection from the north is less. However, the relationship between Cen. typicus and alongshore transport was not significant. The present study highlights the importance of spatial scales in the study of marine populations: observed long term changes in the northern region were different from the south for both species.},

	abstract = {North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis Müller 1776) present an interesting problem for abundance and trend estimation in marine wildlife conservation. They are long lived, individually identifiable, highly mobile, and one of the rarest of cetaceans. Individuals are annually resighted at different rates, primarily due to varying stay durations among several principal habitats within a large geographic range. To date, characterizations of abundance have been produced that use simple accounting procedures with differing assumptions about mortality. To better characterize changing abundance of North Atlantic right whales between 1990 and 2015, we adapted a state–space formulation with Jolly-Seber assumptions about population entry (birth and immigration) to individual resighting histories and fit it using empirical Bayes methodology. This hierarchical model included accommodation for the effect of the substantial individual capture heterogeneity. Estimates from this approach were only slightly higher than published accounting procedures, except for the most recent years (when recapture rates had declined substantially). North Atlantic right whales' abundance increased at about 2.8\% per annum from median point estimates of 270 individuals in 1990 to 483 in 2010, and then declined to 2015, when the final estimate was 458 individuals (95\% credible intervals 444–471). The probability that the population's trajectory post-2010 was a decline was estimated at 99.99\%. Of special concern was the finding that reduced survival rates of adult females relative to adult males have produced diverging abundance trends between sexes. Despite constraints in recent years, both biological (whales' distribution changing) and logistical (fewer resources available to collect individual photo-identifications), it is still possible to detect this relatively recent, small change in the population's trajectory. This is thanks to the massive dataset of individual North Atlantic right whale identifications accrued over the past three decades. Photo-identification data provide biological information that allows more informed inference on the status of this species.},

For measuring progress toward meeting the respective states' water quality standards, a multimetric attainment indicator approach was developed to estimate combined standards attainment. We applied this approach to three decades of monitoring data of DO, water clarity/underwater bay grasses, and chlorophyll-a data on annually updated moving 3-year periods to track the progress in all 92 management segments of tidal waters in Chesapeake Bay. In 2014–2016, 40\% of tidal water segment-DU-criterion combinations in the Bay (n = 291) are estimated to meet thresholds for attainment of their water quality criteria. This index score marks the best 3-year status in the entire record. Since 1985–1987, the indicator has followed a nonlinear trajectory, consistent with impacts from extreme weather events and subsequent recoveries. Over the period of record (1985–2016), the indicator exhibited a positive and statistically significant trend (p {\textless} 0.05), indicating that the Bay has been recovering since 1985. Patterns of attainment of individual DUs are variable, but improvements in open water DO, deep channel DO, and water clarity/submerged aquatic vegetation have combined to drive the improvement in the Baywide indicator in 2014–2016 relative to its long-term median. Finally, the improvement in estimated Baywide attainment was statistically linked to the decline of total nitrogen, indicating responsiveness of attainment status to the reduction of nutrient load through various management actions since at least the 1980s.},

Our cross ecoregion analysis shows that regime shifts in different ecoregions often exhibited very distinct characteristics, emphasizing more granular ﬂuctuations in NES plankton communities relative to previous work. Shifts early in the time series generally reﬂected an increase in abundance levels. The response of zooplankton abundance within fall communities was more similar among ecoregions than for spring communities. The Gulf of Maine exhibited highly distinct patterns from other ecoregions, with regime shifts identiﬁed in the early 1980s, early 2000s, and mid-2000s for spring communities. Regime shifts were identiﬁed in the early to mid-1990s for the NES, Georges Bank, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight ecoregions, while the fall communities experienced shifts in the early 1990s and late 1980s for the NES and Georges Bank, but in the late 1990s in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. A constrained correspondence analysis of zooplankton community against local and basin-scale climatological indices suggests that water temperature, stratiﬁcation, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) were the predominant factors in driving the zooplankton community composition.},

	abstract = {The ability to understand and ultimately predict ecosystem response to multiple pressures is paramount to successfully implement ecosystem-based management. Thresholds shifts and nonlinear patterns in ecosystem responses can be used to determine reference points that identify levels of a pressure that may drastically alter ecosystem status, which can inform management action. However, quantifying ecosystem reference points has proven elusive due in large part to the multi-dimensional nature of both ecosystem pressures and ecosystem responses. We used ecological indicators, synthetic measures of ecosystem status and functioning, to enumerate important ecosystem attributes and to reduce the complexity of the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES LME). Random forests were used to quantify the importance of four environmental and four anthropogenic pressure variables to the value of ecological indicators, and to quantify shifts in aggregate ecological indicator response along pressure gradients. Anthropogenic pressure variables were critical defining features and were able to predict an average of 8-13\% (up to 25-66\% for individual ecological indicators) of the variation in ecological indicator values, whereas environmental pressures were able to predict an average of 1-5 \% (up to 9-26\% for individual ecological indicators) of ecological indicator variation. Each pressure variable predicted a different suite of ecological indicator's variation and the shapes of ecological indicator responses along pressure gradients were generally nonlinear. Threshold shifts in ecosystem response to exploitation, the most important pressure variable, occurred when commercial landings were 20 and 60\% of total surveyed biomass. Although present, threshold shifts in ecosystem response to environmental pressures were much less important, which suggests that anthropogenic pressures have significantly altered the ecosystem structure and functioning of the NES LME. Gradient response curves provide ecologically informed transformations of pressure variables to explain patterns of ecosystem structure and functioning. By concurrently identifying thresholds for a suite of ecological indicator responses to multiple pressures, we demonstrate that ecosystem reference points can be evaluated and used to support ecosystem-based management.},

	abstract = {Climate change and decadal variability are impacting marine fish and invertebrate species worldwide and these impacts will continue for the foreseeable future. Quantitative approaches have been developed to examine climate impacts on productivity, abundance, and distribution of various marine fish and invertebrate species. However, it is difficult to apply these approaches to large numbers of species owing to the lack of mechanistic understanding sufficient for quantitative analyses, as well as the lack of scientific infrastructure to support these more detailed studies. Vulnerability assessments provide a framework for evaluating climate impacts over a broad range of species with existing information. These methods combine the exposure of a species to a stressor (climate change and decadal variability) and the sensitivity of species to the stressor. These two components are then combined to estimate an overall vulnerability. Quantitative data are used when available, but qualitative information and expert opinion are used when quantitative data is lacking. Here we conduct a climate vulnerability assessment on 82 fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf including exploited, forage, and protected species. We define climate vulnerability as the extent to which abundance or productivity of a species in the region could be impacted by climate change and decadal variability. We find that the overall climate vulnerability is high to very high for approximately half the species assessed; diadromous and benthic invertebrate species exhibit the greatest vulnerability. In addition, the majority of species included in the assessment have a high potential for a change in distribution in response to projected changes in climate. Negative effects of climate change are expected for approximately half of the species assessed, but some species are expected to be positively affected (e.g., increase in productivity or move into the region). These results will inform research and management activities related to understanding and adapting marine fisheries management and conservation to climate change and decadal variability.},

	abstract = {The economic and ecological impacts of fish consumption by marine mammals, the associated interactions with commercial fish stocks, and the forage demands of these marine mammal populations are largely unknown. Consumption estimates are often either data deficient or not fully evaluated in a rigorous, quantitative manner. Although consumption estimates exist for the Northeast United States (NEUS) Large Marine Ecosystem, there is considerable uncertainty in those estimates. We examined consumption estimates for 12 marine mammal species inhabiting the regional ecosystem. We used sensitivity analyses to examine metabolically driven daily individual consumption rates, resulting in a suite of feasible parameter-pair ranges for each of three taxonomic groups: mysticetes, odontocetes, and pinnipeds. We expanded daily individual consumption to annual consumption based on abundance estimates of marine mammals found on the NEUS continental shelf coupled with estimates of annual residence time for each species. To examine consumptive removals for specific prey, diet compositions were summarized into major prey categories, and predatory removals by marine mammal species as well as for total marine mammal consumption were estimated for each prey taxa. Bounds on consumption estimates for each marine mammal species were determined using Monte Carlo resampling simulations. Our results suggest that consumption for these 12 marine mammal species combined may be similar in magnitude to commercial fishery landings for small pelagic and groundfish prey groups. Consumption by marine mammals warrants consideration both as a source of mortality in assessments of prey stocks, and to determine marine mammal forage demands in ecosystem assessment models. The approach that we present represents a rigorous, quantitative method to scope the bounds of the biomass that marine mammals are expected to consume, and is appropriate for use in other ecosystems where the interaction between marine mammals and commercial fisheries is thought to be prominent.},

	abstract = {The application of ecosystem considerations, and in particular ecosystem report cards, in federal groundfish fisheries management in Alaska can be described as an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Ecosystem information is provided to managers to establish an ecosystem context within which deliberations of fisheries quota occur. Our goal is to make the case for the need for qualitative ecosystem assessments in EAFM, specifically that qualitative synthesis has advantages worthy to keep a permanent place at the fisheries management table. These advantages include flexibility and speed in responding to and synthesizing new information from a variety of sources. First, we use the development of indicator-based ecosystem report cards as an example of adapting ecosystem information to management needs. Second, we review lessons learned and provide suggestions for best practices for applying EAFM to large and diverse fisheries in multiple marine ecosystems. Adapting ecosystem indicator information to better suit the needs of fisheries managers resulted in succinct report cards that summarize ecosystem trends, complementing more detailed ecosystem information to provide context for EAFM. There were several lessons learned in the process of developing the ecosystem report cards. The selection of indicators for each region was influenced by geography, the extent of scientific knowledge/data, and the particular expertise of the selection teams. Optimizing the opportunity to qualitatively incorporate ecosystem information into management decisions requires a good understanding of the management system in question. We found that frequent dialogue with managers and other stakeholders leads to adaptive products. We believe that there will always be a need for qualitative ecosystem assessment because it allows for rapid incorporation of new ideas and data and unexpected events. As we build modelling and predictive capacity, we will still need qualitative synthesis to capture events outside the bounds of current models and to detect impacts of the unexpected.},

	abstract = {There is long-standing ecological and socioeconomic interest in what controls the diversity and productivity of ecosystems. That focus has intensified with shifting environmental conditions associated with accelerating climate change. The U.S. Northeast Shelf (NES) is a well-studied continental shelf marine ecosystem that is among the more rapidly warming marine systems worldwide. Furthermore, many constituent species have experienced significant distributional shifts. However, the system response of the NES to climate change goes beyond simple shifts in species distribution. The fish and macroinvertebrate communities of the NES have increased in species diversity and overall productivity in recent decades, despite no significant decline in fishing pressure. Species distribution models constructed using random forest classification and regression trees were fit for the dominant species in the system. Over time, the areal distribution of occupancy habitat has increased for approximately 80\% of the modeled taxa, suggesting most species have significantly increased their range and niche space. These niche spaces were analyzed to determine the area of niche overlap between species pairs. For the vast majority of species pairs, interaction has increased over time suggesting greater niche overlap and the increased probability for more intense species interactions, such as between competitors or predators and prey. Furthermore, the species taxonomic composition and size structure indicate a potential tropicalization of the fish community. The system and community changes are consistent with the view that the NES may be transitioning from a cold temperate or boreal ecoregion to one more consistent with the composition of a warm temperate or Carolinian system.},

Independent in situ data suggest that this shift has increased both upper-ocean/deep-ocean interaction events at Line W and open-ocean/shelf interactions across the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) shelf break. Mooring data and along-track altimetry indicate a recent increase in the number of deep cyclones that stir Deep Western Boundary Current waters from the MAB slope into the deep interior.

	abstract = {We present observational evidence that a significant regime change occurred around the year 2000 in the formation of Warm Core Rings (WCRs) from the Gulf Stream (GS) between 75° and 55°W. The dataset for this study is a set of synoptic oceanographic charts available over the thirty-eight-year period of 1980–2017. The upward regime change shows an increase to 33 WCRs per year during 2000–2017 from an average of 18 WCRs during 1980 to 1999. A seasonal analysis confirms May-June-July as the peak time for WCR births in agreement with earlier studies. The westernmost region (75°-70°W) is least ring-productive, while the region from 65°W to 60°W is most productive. This regime shift around 2000 is detected in WCR formation for all of the four 5-degree wide sub-regions and the whole region (75°-55°W). This might be related to a reduction of the deformation radius for ring formation, allowing unstable meanders to shed more frequent rings in recent years. A number of possible factors resulting in such a regime shift related to the possible changes in reduced gravity, instability, transport of the GS, large-scale changes in the wind system and atmospheric fluxes are outlined, which suggest new research directions. The increase in WCRs has likely had an impact on the marine ecosystem since 2000, a topic worthy for future studies.},

Vertebrate predators in the northwest Atlantic consume a variety of prey species, but the proximate composition (PC; proportions of lipid, protein, ash and water) and energy density (ED; kJ g–1) of prey, and their variability, are known poorly. In this study, key prey species from Newfoundland and Labrador were studied: Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides, sand lance Ammodytes dubius, Arctic cod Boreogadus saida, northern shrimp Pandalus borealis, redfish Sebastes spp., Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, squid Illex illecebrosus and Gonatus fabricii, capelin Mallotus villosus, Atlantic herring Clupea harengus and daubed shanny Lumpenus maculatus. PC and ED varied greatly among species and were influenced by size, season, geography and year. Herring, capelin and G. fabricii had the highest ED, whereas Atlantic cod, plaice, sand lance and shrimp had the lowest. Halibut and I. illecebrosus increased in ED with size. EDs of capelin and redfish varied seasonally; that of plaice and sand lance did not. Herring and halibut had higher ED in the early 1990s than in recent years. Such variation in prey ED has important implications for digestive efficiency, foraging energetics, and dietary preferences of vertebrate predators.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem-based management (EBM) in marine ecosystems considers impacts caused by complex interactions between environmental and anthropogenic pressures (i.e. oceanographic, climatic, socio-economic) and marine communities. EBM depends, in part, on ecological indicators that facilitate understanding of inherent properties and the dynamics of pressures within marine communities. Thresholds of ecological indicators delineate ecosystem status because they represent points at which a small increase in one or many pressure variables results in an abrupt change of ecosystem responses. The difficulty in developing appropriate thresholds and reference points for EBM lies in the multidimensionality of both the ecosystem responses and the pressures impacting the ecosystem. Here, we develop thresholds using gradient forest for a suite of ecological indicators in response to multiple pressures that convey ecosystem status for large marine ecosystems from the US Pacific, Atlantic, sub-Arctic, and Gulf of Mexico. We detected these thresholds of ecological indicators based on multiple pressures. Commercial fisheries landings above approximately 2-4.5 t km-2 and fisheries exploitation above 20-40\% of the total estimated biomass (of invertebrates and fish) of the ecosystem resulted in a change in the direction of ecosystem structure and functioning in the ecosystems examined. Our comparative findings reveal common trends in ecosystem thresholds along pressure gradients and also indicate that thresholds of ecological indicators are useful tools for comparing the impacts of environmental and anthropogenic pressures across multiple ecosystems. These critical points can be used to inform the development of EBM decision criteria.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus).

Defining trends and thresholds in responses of ecological indicators to fishing and environmental pressures. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 755–767. Both fishing and environmental forces can influence the structure of marine ecosystems. To further understand marine ecosystems and to implement ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), an evaluation of ecosystem indicators is warranted. In this context, it is particularly important to identify thresholds where fishing and environmental pressures significantly influence ecological indicators. We empirically determined numerical values of environmental forces and fishing pressure that significantly altered the response of ecological indicators for the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem. Generalized additive models predicted a non-linear relationship for each pressure–response pairing. With this smoother, 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for estimated first and second derivatives for each relationship were determined via parametric bootstrap. A significant trend or threshold was noted when the CI for the first or second derivative was greater or less than zero, delineating the level at which pressure variables influence the rate and direction of ecosystem indicator responses. We identify reference levels where environmental forces and fishing pressure result in ecosystem change by collectively examining the responses of multiple ecological indicators. Individual indicators showed unique responses to pressures, however, similar values for the pressures were associated with significant changes for multiple indicators. These reference levels establish a foundation for implementation of EBFM.},

We propose a state-space assessment model that is expanded to simultaneously treat environmental covariates as stochastic processes and estimate their effects on recruitment. We apply the model to southern New England yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) using data from the most recent benchmark assessment to evaluate evidence for effects of the mid-Atlantic cold pool and spawning stock biomass on recruitment. Based on Akaike’s information criterion, both the cold pool and spawning stock biomass were important predictors of recruitment and led to annual variation in estimated biomass reference points and associated yield. We also demonstrate the effect of the stochasticity of the mid-Atlantic cold pool on short-term forecasts of the stock size, biomass reference point, and stock status.},

	abstract = {The Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) Cold Pool is a distinctive cold (lower than 10 ∘C) and relatively fresh (lower than 34 practical salinity unit) water mass. It is located over the middle and outer shelf of the MAB, below the seasonal thermocline, and is attached to the bottom. Following this deﬁnition, we put forward a method that includes three criteria to capture and quantify Cold Pool characteristics, based on a 50-year (1958–2007) high-resolution regional ocean model hindcast. The seasonal climatology of the Cold Pool and its properties are investigated during its onset-peak-decline cycle. Three stages of the Cold Pool event are deﬁned according to its evolution and characteristics. The Cold Pool cores travel along the 60-m isobath starting south of the New England shelf to the Hudson Shelf Valley at a speed of 2–3 cm/s. Furthermore, the northern extent of the Cold Pool retreats about 2.6 times faster than the southern extent during the summer progression. The heat balance of near-bottom waters over the MAB and Georges Bank is computed and it is found that the heat advection, rather than vertical diﬀusion, dominates the resulting spatial patterns of warming. Possible origins of the Cold Pool are investigated by performing a lead-lag correlation analysis. Results suggest that the Cold Pool originates not only from local remnants of winter water near the Nantucket Shoals, but has an upstream source traveling in the spring time from the southwestern ﬂank of the Georges Bank along the 80-m isobath.},

Sampling occurred in spring and autumn, which was adequate to collect immature, mature, spawning-active, and non-active females. Females were collected in coastal waters from Delaware Bay, USA, to the Scotian Shelf, Canada, including in Long Island Sound and on Georges Bank, which covered all U.S. stock areas. Mature fish spawned in spring, when gonads comprised up to 30\% of the total body weight. Direct comparisons of maturity assignment by macroscopic versus microscopic methods demonstrated that both schemes are compatible, but the more cost-effective macroscopic method had trouble distinguishing larger immature from smaller resting females. Spatial comparisons, using gonad histology only, supported the existence of three stocks in U.S. waters, but also revealed significant variation in age at maturity within the two coastal stocks. Age-at-maturity was more variable than size-at-maturity, which is consistent with known stock-specific patterns of growth rates and a postulated life history tradeoff to delay maturity until a size threshold is reached. The within-stock variation in median age at maturity, about one year for coastal stocks, recommends further investigation of using static, stock-specific maturity ogives to calculate reference points for management.},

	abstract = {Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus are iteroparous (repeat spawners) with group-synchronous oocyte development and determinate fecundity, and they are total spawners. However, they also exhibit plasticity in other aspects of their reproductive biology including spawning seasonality and skipped spawning. Previous studies in other regions have reported skipped spawning and errors in macroscopic classifications of maturity, both of which could bias estimates of reproductive potential, but a critical assessment of these in U.S. waters is lacking. In the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank, herring are assessed as a single stock complex, where females typically mature as 3 to 4 year olds and may live up to 11 years. To evaluate the magnitude of skipped spawning, we collected the ovaries of Atlantic Herring from fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources over multiple seasons and evaluated them histologically to assess imminent (indicated by vitellogenic or maturing oocytes) or recent spawning (evidenced by the presence of postovulatory follicles). Gonad histology allowed us to determine spawning seasonality and skipped spawning. Macroscopic maturity classification was more accurate in fall (1–4\% incorrect maturity) than in spring (7\% incorrect maturity). The spatial distributions of immature and mature fish from both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources differed, which affected the estimation of maturity at length and age. We estimated 9–14\% spring spawners in the region, but we did not find evidence of skipped spawning. The time series of the macroscopic data that were available (1987–2018) showed increases in spring spawning with latitude, but the proportions have not changed much over recent decades. The effects of up to 30\% spring or skipped spawning on a stock assessment of Atlantic Herring were evaluated. Spring spawning had little effect relative to assuming 100\% fall spawning (the current assumption), and skipped spawning decreased the scale of spawning stock biomass (SSB) and related reference points, with the degree of change increasing with skipped spawning rates, but it had few consequences otherwise.},

Females produced 46 larvae per gram body weight. Body weight was the single best predictor of fecundity (r2 = 0.57), with Fulton's condition factor (range 1.041.76) explaining no significant additional variation over length or weight.

Contrary to that previously proposed for gadoid species, histological analysis of field-caught immature M. aeglefinus during the spawning season indicated that cortical alveolar, rather than circumnuclear ring, stage oocytes provided definitive evidence of maturation. A decrease in relative liver size following the summer solstice suggested a possible link between energy status and maturation.},

	abstract = {Oogenesis in fishes follows a universal plan; yet, due to differences in the synchrony and rate of egg development, spawning frequency varies from daily to once in a lifetime. Some species spawn and feed in separate areas, during different seasons, by storing energy and drawing on it later for reproduction (i.e. capital breeding). Other species spawn using energy acquired locally, throughout a prolonged spawning season, allocating energy directly to reproduction (i.e. income breeding). Capital breeders tend to ovulate all at once and are more likely to be distributed at boreal latitudes. Income breeding allows small fish to overcome allometric constraints on egg production. Income breeders can recover more quickly when good-feeding conditions are re-established, which is a benefit to adults regarding bet-hedging spawning strategies. Many species exhibit mixed capital- and income-breeding patterns. An individual's position along this capital–income continuum may shift with ontogeny or in relation to environmental conditions, so breeding patterns are a conditional reproductive strategy. Poor-feeding environments can lead to delayed maturation, skipped spawning, fewer spawning events per season or fewer eggs produced per event. In a few cases, variations in feeding environments appear to affect recruitment variability. These flexible processes of energy acquisition and allocation allow females to prioritize their own condition over their propagules' condition at any given spawning opportunity, thereby investing energy cautiously to maximize lifetime reproductive value. These findings have implications for temporal and spatial sampling designs, for measurement and interpretation of fecundity, and for interpreting fishery and ecosystem assessments.},

	abstract = {The influence of a lower condition on reproductive investment, somatic energy losses, and postspawning condition of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was examined under the hypothesis that females, in response to lower available energy reserves, would reduce reproductive investment in order to limit somatic energy losses. Laboratory experiments revealed that female cod with high prespawning condition factors ended reproduction in better condition than females with low prespawning condition factors. Fecundity and total egg dry weight were significantly lower in poor-condition females. The loss in somatic mass and energy in these poor-condition females was nevertheless higher, in relative terms, than the losses experienced by females in good condition. Consequently, energy reserves invested in reproduction by poor-condition females increase their risk of mortality. In the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence during the early 1990s, reproductive females had lower fecundities and were in worse prespawning and postspawning condition. The condition of spent females suggested a greater impact of changes in environmental conditions on adult than on immature cod. Reproductive potential and possibly recruitment may have suffered from that situation and could have contributed to the failure of that stock to recover despite the moratorium on commercial fishing.},

However, unlike Atlantic herring, there is little research on sand lance or information about drivers of their abundance. We use intra-annual measurements of sand lance diet, growth, and condition to explain annual variability in sand lance abundance on the Northeast US Shelf. Our observations indicate that northern sand lance feed, grow, and accumulate lipids in the late winter through summer, predominantly consuming the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Sand lance then cease feeding, utilize lipids, and begin gonad development in the fall. We show that the abundance of C. finmarchicus influences sand lance parental condition and recruitment. Atlantic herring can mute this effect through intra-guild predation. Hydrography further impacts sand lance abundance as increases in warm slope water decrease overwinter survival of reproductive adults. The predicted changes to these drivers indicate that sand lance will no longer be able to fill the role of lipid-rich forage during times of low Atlantic herring abundance—changing the Northeast US shelf forage fish complex by the end of the century.},

	abstract = {As the number of fish reproduction studies has proliferated, so has the number of gonadal classification schemes and terms. This has made it difficult for both scientists and resource managers to communicate and for comparisons to be made among studies. We propose the adoption of a simple, universal terminology for the phases in the reproductive cycle, which can be applied to all male and female elasmobranch and teleost fishes. These phases were chosen because they define key milestones in the reproductive cycle; the phases include immature, developing, spawning capable, regressing, and regenerating. Although the temporal sequence of events during gamete development in each phase may vary among species, each phase has specific histological and physiological markers and is conceptually universal. The immature phase can occur only once. The developing phase signals entry into the gonadotropin-dependent stage of oogenesis and spermatogenesis and ultimately results in gonadal growth. The spawning capable phase includes (1) those fish with gamete development that is sufficiently advanced to allow for spawning within the current reproductive cycle and (2) batch-spawning females that show signs of previous spawns (i.e., postovulatory follicle complex) and that are also capable of additional spawns during the current cycle. Within the spawning capable phase, an actively spawning subphase is defined that corresponds to hydration and ovulation in females and spermiation in males. The regressing phase indicates completion of the reproductive cycle and, for many fish, completion of the spawning season. Fish in the regenerating phase are sexually mature but reproductively inactive. Species-specific histological criteria or classes can be incorporated within each of the universal phases, allowing for more specific divisions (subphases) while preserving the overall reproductive terminology for comparative purposes. This terminology can easily be modified for fishes with alternate reproductive strategies, such as hermaphrodites (addition of a transition phase) and livebearers (addition of a gestation phase).},

The indicator uses metrics of dissolved oxygen concentrations, water clarity assessments, underwater bay grass acreages, and season-specific chlorophyll a distributions. This suite of metrics is recognized as symptomatic of eutrophication and responsive to nutrient and sediment management actions. Habitat criteria for these metrics were established by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to protect the survival, growth, and reproduction of tidal bay living resources. The criteria were adopted into state WQS used to define outcome targets of the regulatory 2010 Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). Direct accounting of monitoring results compared with state standards would be the most direct measure of water quality status related to achieving habitat health goal conditions under the TMDL. However, the Chesapeake Bay Program long-term water quality monitoring program that supports Clean Water Act 303d water quality impairment assessments does not provide sufficient measurement resolution across all temporal scales represented in these TMDL-related WQS. Recognizing data and analysis gaps, we developed the indicator to provide estimates of WQS attainment for the Chesapeake Bay. The structure of the indicator uses metrics that have been measured consistently with the historical Chesapeake Bay tidal water quality data collections since 1985. The ability to compute scores on contemporary and historical data will provide for bay-wide and spatially explicit long-term trend evaluations of habitat quality.},

Previous studies suggest the species is vulnerable to the effects of global warming, particularly on the Northeast U.S. Shelf, which is in the southern portion of its range. In this study, we evaluate an ensemble of six different downscaled climate models and a high-resolution global climate model, and create a generalized additive model (GAM) to examine how future changes in temperature and salinity could affect the distribution and density of C. finmarchicus. By 2081–2100, we project average C. finmarchicus density will decrease by as much as 50\% under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. These decreases are particularly pronounced in the spring and summer in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank. When compared to a high-resolution global climate model, the ensemble showed a more uniform change throughout the Northeast U.S. Shelf, while the high-resolution model showed larger decreases in the Northeast Channel, Shelf Break, and Central Gulf of Maine. C. finmarchicus is an important link between primary production and higher trophic levels, and the decrease projected here could be detrimental to the North Atlantic Right Whale and a host of important fishery species.},

All of these taxa showed a large proportional increase in winter abundance between the 1980s and 1990s. These changes could be driven by increased primary productivity during winter, caused by a large-scale freshening of the Northwest Atlantic Shelf. In addition to the “community shift” mode, the analysis found a strong mode of interannual variability attributed to previously described changes in the abundance of late-stage Calanus finmarchicus. To explore the impact of these modes on higher trophic levels, we correlated the zooplankton modes with recruitment time-series from 12 fish stocks from the Gulf of Maine region. Several significant correlations were found, suggesting that the changes in the zooplankton modes may reflect broad changes in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem.},

	abstract = {We examine the long-term co-occurrence of long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) and white-winged scoters (Melanitta fusca) wintering at the Nantucket Shoals off Massachusetts, USA, and ask: (1) What oceanographic features attract these aggregations? (2) How are distributions of prey and sea ducks related to one another? and (3) What is the explanation for the spatial association between these two species? A winter concentration of long-tailed ducks on the order of 3 × 105 birds have been present near Nantucket Island and the Nantucket Shoals since the 1970s, and there is evidence of some concentration there since the late 1800s. Despite the difference in diet, the two duck species overlap in spatial distribution in relation to a prominent tidal front on the west side of Nantucket Shoals where nested swarms of pelagic amphipods and massive clam beds occur in persistent broadscale concentrations. Gammarid amphipods were collected seasonally by bongo tows over 39 yr (1977–2016), and Atlantic surf clams and ocean quahogs were collected by hydraulic dredge over a 34-yr timescale (1982–2016). Long-tailed ducks and white-winged scoters were counted during systematic low-level aerial surveys. Both long-tailed ducks and white-winged scoters associated with amphipod and clam aggregations at similar scales, and tracked amphipod and clam concentrations at larger spatial scales, up to 30 km. These multi-scalar nested associations suggest that the sea ducks foraged within a hierarchical patch system structured by the tidal regime, and concentrated in areas of spatially anchored recurring prey, with highest densities in southwest areas. Enhanced concentrations of prey within a relatively narrow zone on Nantucket Shoals provide a predictable food resource to wintering sea ducks whose populations are in decline. As supported by our generalized additive models, we propose that the positive spatial associations among these species are at least partly explained by local enhancement or facilitation, whereby each species of duck derives foraging benefit from noting the location of aggregations of the other. This interaction will be important to the designation of marine protected areas.},

	abstract = {Plankton community structure changes seasonally in response to the annual cycles of stratification, temperature, and primary productivity. These communities also change from year-to-year, in some cases exhibiting persistent regime shifts. How changes in physical conditions structure the plankton community and why conditions persist is a fundamental question in oceanography. Continuous plankton recorders have been used to sample the plankton community across the Gulf of Maine since 1961. Historically, this community has had a classic subarctic structure dominated by Calanus finmarchicus. However, during the 1990s, C. finmarchicus became less prominent, and a more diverse community of smaller copepods emerged. This shift was related to an influx of cold, low-salinity water. We show that a similar community shift occurred around 2012. We use high-resolution hydrographic data to link the shift to an influx of saltier water and warmer conditions. By comparing the 1990s with the recent decade, we develop a synthesis for how physical changes lead to community shifts. Our synthesis suggests that the link between the 1990s and 2010s is enhanced water column stratification. We further propose that ecological interactions link declines in C. finmarchicus with the emergence of the more diverse community, drawing parallels with classic food web ecology.},

	abstract = {The well-documented value of marine fisheries is threatened by overfishing. Management typically focuses on target populations but lacks effective tools to document or restrain overexploitation of marine ecosystems. Here, we present three indices and accompanying thresholds to detect and delineate ecosystem overfishing (EOF): the Fogarty, Friedland, and Ryther indices. These are based on widely available and readily interpreted catch and satellite data that link fisheries landings to primary production using known limits of trophic transfer efficiency. We propose theoretically and empirically based thresholds for each of those indices; with these criteria, several ecosystems are fished sustainably, but nearly 40 to 50\% of tropical and temperate ecosystems exceed even extreme thresholds. Applying these criteria to global fisheries data results in strong evidence for two specific instances of EOF, increases in both pressure on tropical fish and a climate-mediated polar shift. Here, we show that these two patterns represent evidence for global EOF.
Newly derived thresholds show that about half the world’s marine ecosystems are experiencing “ecosystem” overfishing.

We quantified interannual variation in anomalies of abundance and biomass of Calanus spp. and near-surface and near-bottom ocean temperature and salinity from 19 subregions spanning the Gulf of Maine–Georges Bank (GoM–GBK), Scotian Shelf (SS), Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) and Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves. We analyzed time series from 1977 to 2016 in GoM–GBK, 1982 to 2016 in southwest GSL and 1999 to 2016 in remaining areas. Calanus finmarchicus dominated abundance and biomass, except in the GSL where Calanus hyperboreus was abundant. The biomass of Calanus spp. declined in many subregions over years 1999–2016 and was negatively correlated with sea surface temperature in GoM–GBK and on the SS. We detected ``regime shifts” to lower biomass of Calanus spp. in the GoM–GBK in 2010 and on the SS in 2011. In the GoM–GBK, shifts to lower biomass of C. finmarchicus coincided with shifts to warmer ocean temperature and with published reports of changes in spatial distribution and reduced calving rate of NARW. We hypothesize that warming has negatively impacted population levels of Calanus spp. near their southern range limit, reducing the availability of prey to NARW.},

This has had implications for the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, a critical food supply for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). The oceanographic changes have driven a deviation in the seasonal foraging patterns of E. glacialis upon which conservation strategies depend, making the whales more vulnerable to ship strikes and gear entanglements.

Here, we examine oceanic, atmospheric, and biological factors that may affect the increasing trend of cold-stunned Kemp’s ridleys in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, United States of America. Using machine learning and Bayesian inference modeling techniques, we demonstrate higher cold-stunning years occur when the Gulf of Maine has warmer sea surface temperatures in late October through early November. Surprisingly, hatchling numbers in Mexico, a proxy for population abundance, was not identified as an important factor. Further, using our Bayesian count model and forecasted sea surface temperature projections, we predict more than 2,300 Kemp’s ridley turtles may cold-stun annually by 2031 as sea surface temperatures continue to increase within the Gulf of Maine. We suggest warmer sea surface temperatures may have modified the northerly distribution of Kemp’s ridleys and act as an ecological bridge between the Gulf Stream and nearshore waters. While cold-stunning may currently account for a minor proportion of juvenile mortality, we recommend continuing efforts to rehabilitate cold-stunned individuals to maintain population resiliency for this critically endangered species in the face of a changing climate and continuing anthropogenic threats.},

In 2010, the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf regions of the Northwest Atlantic underwent an unprecedented regime shift. Forced by climate-driven changes in the Gulf Stream, warm slope waters entered the region and created a less favorable foraging environment for the endangered North Atlantic right whale population. By mid-decade, right whales had shifted their late spring/summer foraging grounds from the Gulf of Maine and the western Scotian Shelf to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The population also began exhibiting unusually high mortality in 2017. Here, we report that climate-driven changes in ocean circulation have altered the foraging environment and habitat use of right whales, reducing the population’s calving rate and exposing it to greater mortality risks from ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement.

In the Northeast United States, previous studies suggest that the recruitment of Southern New England-Mid Atlantic yellowtail flounder is closely related to the strength of the Cold Pool, a seasonally formed cold water mass on the continental shelf. Here, we developed three new indices that enhance the characterization of Cold Pool interannual variations using bottom temperature from a regional hindcast ocean model and a global ocean data assimilated hindcast. We associated these new indices to yellowtail flounder recruitment in a state–space, age-structured stock assessment framework using the Woods Hole Assessment Model. We demonstrate that incorporating Cold Pool effects on yellowtail flounder recruitment reduces the retrospective patterns and may improve the predictive skill of recruitment and, to a lesser extent, spawning stock biomass. We also show that the performance of the assessment models that incorporated ocean model-based indices is improved compared to the model using only the observation-based index. Instead of relying on limited subsurface observations, using validated ocean model products as environmental covariates in stock assessments may both improve predictions and facilitate operationalization.},

	abstract = {The Northeast US Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem is experiencing warming at a rate exceeding that of many other large marine ecosystems and has undergone significant climate-related changes. We examined the effect of thermal events and shifting patterns of primary and secondary productivity on the distribution of fish and macroinvertebrate species during the period 1968–2016. Though subject to inter-annual change, the along-shelf centre of gravity of chlorophyll concentration lacked a trend. Similarly, zooplankton bio-volume and total abundance along-shelf distance were also found to be without trend. However, the trend in the centre of gravity of copepod taxa diverged from the trends in bio-volume and non-copepod zooplankton abundance, suggesting most of these taxa had shifted in distribution to the northeast. The centres of gravity of fish and macroinvertebrate species have trended significantly to the northeast, suggesting copepods may play a key role in the distribution of higher trophic levels. Analysis of thermal events suggest that abrupt change in temperature can actuate persistent change in the distribution of fish and macroinvertebrate species. In aggregate, these broad trophic level patterns imply that distributional changes affecting upper trophic levels were dominated by thermal mechanisms, whereas lower trophic productivity, although subject to the same thermal conditions, exhibited less of a response. We hypothesize this lack of distributional response at lower trophic levels is due to their higher rates of production and turnover, and hence reflect a capacity to better integrate seasonal thermal changes. Furthermore, distributional changes of upper trophic levels may also be significantly impacted by feeding interactions at specific life history stages, where temperature affects both predator and prey.},

	abstract = {Abstract The formulation of the sensor-specific error statistics (SSES) has been redesigned in the latest implementation of the NOAA Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Oceans (ACSPO) to enable efficient use of SSES for assimilation of the ACSPO baseline regression SST (BSST) into level 4 (L4) analyses. The SSES algorithm employs segmentation of the SST domain in the space of regressors and derives the segmentation parameter from the statistics of regressors within the global dataset of matchups. For each segment, local regression coefficients and standard deviations (SDs) of BSST minus in situ SST are calculated from the corresponding subset of matchups. The local regression coefficients are used to generate an auxiliary product—piecewise regression (PWR) SST—and SSES biases are estimated as differences between BSST and PWR SST. Correction of SSES biases, which transforms BSST back into PWR SST, reduces the effects of residual cloud; variations in view zenith angle; and, during the daytime, diurnal surface warming. This results in significant reduction in the global SD of fitting in situ SST, making it comparable with SD for the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) L4 SST. Unlike the foundation CMC SST (which is consistent with in situ SST at night but biased cold during the daytime), the PWR SST is consistent with in situ data during both day and night and thus may be viewed as an estimate of “depth” in situ SST. The PWR SST is expected to be a useful input into L4 SST analyses, especially for foundation SST products, such as the CMC L4.},

The two systems use different SST retrieval and cloud masking algorithms. Validation against in situ and L4 analyses has shown suboptimal performance of the IDPS product. In this context, existing operational and proposed SST algorithms have been evaluated for their potential implementation in IDPS. This paper documents the evaluation methodology and results. The performance of SST retrievals is characterized with bias and standard deviation with respect to in situ SSTs and sensitivity to true SST. Given three retrieval metrics, all being variable in space and with observational conditions, an additional integral metric is needed to evaluate the overall performance of SST algorithms. Therefore, we introduce the Quality Retrieval Domain (QRD) as a part of the global ocean, where the retrieval characteristics meet predefined specifications. Based on the QRDs analyses for all tested algorithms over a representative range of specifications for accuracy, precision, and sensitivity, we have selected the algorithms developed at the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) for implementation in IDPS and ACSPO. Testing the OSI-SAF algorithms with ACSPO and IDPS products shows the improved consistency between VIIRS SST and Reynolds L4 daily analysis. Further improvement of the IDPS SST product requires adjustment of the VIIRS cloud and ice masks.},

The hydrographic data were obtained on 49 surveys of the shelf between 1977 and 1987. In each region the shelf water volume exhibits a significant annual cycle with a range of 50–80\% of the mean volume. The annual volume cycle appears to be advected southwestward from Georges Bank through the MAB with the mean circulation. Large interannual changes in volume are observed which have a range comparable to the mean volume of Shelf Water in the MAB. Both the seasonal and interannual changes in volume appear to be related to changes in the inflow to the Gulf of Maine through Northeast Channel and from the Scotian Shelf.},

	abstract = {The distribution of marine species is changing as a direct result of climate change. Large pelagic highly migratory species (HMS), like tunas, billfishes, and sharks, are particularly sensitive to environmental change due to their migratory nature and use of large-scale ocean features. These temporal and spatial shifts are likely reflected in the Atlantic HMS recreational fishery and could have downstream effects on coastal communities. We utilized dockside intercept data from the Large Pelagics Survey (LPS) from 2002 to 2019, which conducts sampling from June to October and spans Maine to Virginia, USA. We assessed how species catch composition has changed and developed spatiotemporal models to understand latitudinal and temporal shifts in the recreational catch of 12 HMS groups. Latitudinal shifts were significantly affected by Northeast Shelf SST for 11 of the 12 HMS groups and ranged from 3 ± 1 km°C−1 for the large bluefin tuna to 40 ± 1 km°C−1 for the blue shark. In addition, the estimated day of the year when the first 25\% of bigeye tuna intercepts occurred, happened over 50 days earlier in 2019 compared to 2002, suggesting the initial catch is happening earlier in recent years. These results suggest that changes in species distribution and phenology are affecting where and when HMS recreational catch occurs. Understanding these shifts would allow managers to be more responsive and flexible and also help communities prepare for changes, whether it would be a switch to a new species or shifts in the fishing season.},

	abstract = {The timing of recurring biological and seasonal environmental events is changing on a global scale relative to temperature and other climate drivers. This study considers the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, a region of high social and ecological importance in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and synthesizes current knowledge of (a) key seasonal processes, patterns, and events; (b) direct evidence for shifts in timing; (c) implications of phenological responses for linked ecological-human systems; and (d) potential phenology-focused adaptation strategies and actions. Twenty studies demonstrated shifts in timing of regional marine organisms and seasonal environmental events. The most common response was earlier timing, observed in spring onset, spring and winter hydrology, zooplankton abundance, occurrence of several larval fishes, and diadromous fish migrations. Later timing was documented for fall onset, reproduction and fledging in Atlantic puffins, spring and fall phytoplankton blooms, and occurrence of additional larval fishes. Changes in event duration generally increased and were detected in zooplankton peak abundance, early life history periods of macro-invertebrates, and lobster fishery landings. Reduced duration was observed in winter–spring ice-affected stream flows. Two studies projected phenological changes, both finding diapause duration would decrease in zooplankton under future climate scenarios. Phenological responses were species-specific and varied depending on the environmental driver, spatial, and temporal scales evaluated. Overall, a wide range of baseline phenology and relevant modeling studies exist, yet surprisingly few document long-term shifts. Results reveal a need for increased emphasis on phenological shifts in the Gulf of Maine and identify opportunities for future research and consideration of phenological changes in adaptation efforts.},

	abstract = {Climate change and climate variability are affecting marine mammal species and these impacts are projected to continue in the coming decades. Vulnerability assessments provide a framework for evaluating climate impacts over a broad range of species using currently available information. We conducted a trait-based climate vulnerability assessment using expert elicitation for 108 marine mammal stocks and stock groups in the western North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. Our approach combined the exposure (projected change in environmental conditions) and sensitivity (ability to tolerate and adapt to changing conditions) of marine mammal stocks to estimate vulnerability to climate change, and categorize stocks with a vulnerability index. The climate vulnerability score was very high for 44\% (n = 47) of these stocks, high for 29\% (n = 31), moderate for 20\% (n = 22), and low for 7\% (n = 8). The majority of stocks (n = 78; 72\%) scored very high exposure, whereas 24\% (n = 26) scored high, and 4\% (n = 4) scored moderate. The sensitivity score was very high for 33\% (n = 36) of these stocks, high for 18\% (n = 19), moderate for 34\% (n = 37), and low for 15\% (n = 16). Vulnerability results were summarized for stocks in five taxonomic groups: pinnipeds (n = 4; 25\% high, 75\% moderate), mysticetes (n = 7; 29\% very high, 57\% high, 14\% moderate), ziphiids (n = 8; 13\% very high, 50\% high, 38\% moderate), delphinids (n = 84; 52\% very high, 23\% high, 15\% moderate, 10\% low), and other odontocetes (n = 5; 60\% high, 40\% moderate). Factors including temperature, ocean pH, and dissolved oxygen were the primary drivers of high climate exposure, with effects mediated through prey and habitat parameters. We quantified sources of uncertainty by bootstrapping vulnerability scores, conducting leave-one-out analyses of individual attributes and individual scorers, and through scoring data quality for each attribute. These results provide information for researchers, managers, and the public on marine mammal responses to climate change to enhance the development of more effective marine mammal management, restoration, and conservation activities that address current and future environmental variation and biological responses due to climate change.},

	abstract = {The size structure of phytoplankton communities influences important ecological and biogeochemical processes, including the transfer of energy through marine food webs. A variety of algorithms have been developed to estimate phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) from satellite ocean color data. However, many of these algorithms were developed for application to the global ocean, and their performance in more productive, optically complex coastal and continental shelf regions warrants evaluation. In this study, several existing PSC models were applied in the Northeast U.S. continental shelf (NES) region and compared with in situ PSC estimates derived from a local HPLC pigment data set. The effect of regional re-parameterization and incorporation of sea surface temperature (SST) into existing abundance-based model frameworks was investigated and model performance was assessed using an independent data set. Abundance-based model re-parameterization alone did not result in significant improvement in model performance compared with other models. However, the inclusion of SST led to a consistent reduction in model error for all size classes. Of two absorption-based algorithms tested, the best performing approach displayed similar performance metrics to the regional SST-dependent abundance-based model. The SST-dependent model and the absorption-based method were applied to monthly composites of the NES region for April and September 2019 and qualitatively compared. The results highlight the benefit of considering SST in abundance-based models and the applicability of absorption-based PSC methods in optically complex regions.},

	abstract = {Species' response to rapid climate change can be measured through shifts in timing of recurring biological events, known as phenology. The Gulf of Maine is one of the most rapidly warming regions of the ocean, and thus an ideal system to study phenological and biological responses to climate change. A better understanding of climate-induced changes in phenology is needed to effectively and adaptively manage human-wildlife conflicts. Using data from a 20+ year marine mammal observation program, we tested the hypothesis that the phenology of large whale habitat use in Cape Cod Bay has changed and is related to regional-scale shifts in the thermal onset of spring. We used a multi-season occupancy model to measure phenological shifts and evaluate trends in the date of peak habitat use for North Atlantic right (Eubalaena glacialis), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), and fin (Balaenoptera physalus) whales. The date of peak habitat use shifted by +18.1 days (0.90 days/year) for right whales and +19.1 days (0.96 days/year) for humpback whales. We then evaluated interannual variability in peak habitat use relative to thermal spring transition dates (STD), and hypothesized that right whales, as planktivorous specialist feeders, would exhibit a stronger response to thermal phenology than fin and humpback whales, which are more generalist piscivorous feeders. There was a significant negative effect of western region STD on right whale habitat use, and a significant positive effect of eastern region STD on fin whale habitat use indicating differential responses to spatial seasonal conditions. Protections for threatened and endangered whales have been designed to align with expected phenology of habitat use. Our results show that whales are becoming mismatched with static seasonal management measures through shifts in their timing of habitat use, and they suggest that effective management strategies may need to alter protections as species adapt to climate change.},

Gray seals (Halichoerus grypus (Fabricius, 1791)) were considered locally extinct in United States waters by 1958 but have since recolonized the region. Although considered generalists, less is known about gray seal foraging ecology in the United States. To address this, we used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses to investigate the foraging niches of adult gray seals in Massachusetts, USA. We examined skin, fur, and blood components to investigate seasonal variability and individual consistency in foraging niches, and serially sampled vibrissae to quantify the degree of individual foraging specialization in this population. Our results suggest that seals shift from coastal foraging habitats before molt to offshore habitats after molt, with a coincident shift from higher to lower trophic-level prey. Adult gray seals also exhibited individual consistency in foraging niches independent of population-level shifts and reflect a generalist population composed of individual foraging specialists. These findings serve as a baseline for subsequent research on gray seals in United States waters that could help to determine the mechanisms which promote individual specialization in this population.},

In the Gulf of Maine, increasing grey seal populations have the potential to impact commercially important groundfish species such as cod and haddock, but the potential also exists for more complex ecological interactions to occur given the recent increase of spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), another potential groundfish predator. Specifically, seal predation on dogfish could free groundfish species from additional predation pressure. Little quantitative data exists on intraguild predation rates by grey seals on spiny dogfish, in part because of the limitations of current methods of food habits analysis for grey seals. We report the development, validation, and field testing of a non-invasive genetic method for the detection of spiny dogfish in grey seal diets using DNA collected from seal feces. Our method amplified spiny dogfish DNA from 10 of 10 positive control scats from a captive seal with a known diet, and amplified spiny dogfish DNA from 0 of 10 negative control scats. We field tested the method on 20 scats from wild seals and detected spiny dogfish in two of the samples. All positive amplifications were sequenced to verify the species identify, and all were spiny dogfish. Our method has the potential to provide valuable information about changing predator prey dynamics in the Gulf of Maine and elsewhere.},

Central to these issues is the foraging ecology and diet composition of the seals. We studied grey seal feeding habits through next-generation sequencing of prey DNA using 16S amplicons from seal scat (n = 74) collected from a breeding colony on Monomoy Island in Massachusetts, USA, and report frequency of occurrence and relative read abundance. We also assigned seal sex to scat samples using a revised PCR assay. In contrast to current understanding of grey seal diet from hard parts and fatty acid analysis, we found no significant difference between male and female diet measured by alpha and beta diversity. Overall, we detected 24 prey groups, 18 of which resolved to species. Sand lance Ammodytes spp. were the most frequently consumed prey group, with a frequency of occurrence (FO) of 97.3\%, consistent with previous studies, but Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus, the second most frequently consumed species (FO = 60.8\%), has not previously been documented in US grey seal diet. Our results suggest that a metabarcoding approach to seal food habits can yield important new ecological insights, but that traditional hard parts analysis does not underestimate consumption of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (FO = 6.7\%, Gadidae spp.) and salmon Salmo salar (FO = 0\%), 2 particularly valuable species of concern.},

Suggested priorities are: 1) Determining the impact of multiple stressors on our resource species as well as the magnitude of acidification; 2) Filling information gaps on major taxa and regionally important species in different life stages to improve understanding of their response to variable temporal scales and sources of acidification; 3) Improving experimental approaches to incorporate realistic environmental variability and gradients, include interactions with other environmental stressors, increase transferability to other systems or organisms, and evaluate community and ecosystem response; 4) Determining the capacity of important species to acclimate or adapt to changing ocean conditions; 5) Considering multi-disciplinary, ecosystem-level research that examines acidification impacts on biodiversity and biotic interactions; and 6) Connecting potential acidification-induced ecological impacts to ecosystem services and the economy. These recommendations, while developed for the Mid-Atlantic, can be applicable to other regions will help align research towards knowledge of potential larger-scale ecological and economic impacts.},

The Atlantic longfin squid, Doryteuthis pealeii, a core component of the Northwest Atlantic trophic web, has demonstrated impacts, such as reduced growth and delayed development, under high chronic exposure to acidification (2200 ppm), but the combined effects of OA and warming have not been explored in this species. In this study, D. pealeii egg capsules were reared under a combination of several acidification levels (400, 2200, and 3500 ppm) and temperatures (20 and 27°C). Hatchlings were measured for a range of metrics [dorsal mantle length (DML), yolk sac volume (YV), malformation, and hatching success] in three trials over the 2016 breeding season (May – October). Although notable resistance to stressors was seen, highlighting variability within and between clutches, reduced DML and malformation of the embryos occurred at the highest OA exposure. Surprisingly, increased temperatures did not appear to exacerbate OA impacts, although responses were variable. Time to hatching, which increased with acidification, decreased much more drastically under warming and, further, decreased or removed delays caused by acidification. Hatching success, while variable by clutch, showed consistent patterns of greater late stage loss of embryos under acidification and greater early stage loss under warming, highlighting the potential difference in timing between these stressors for this system, i.e., that acidification stress builds up and causes impacts over time within the egg capsule as the embryos grow and respire. High OA-exposed hatchlings from the warmer conditions often showed reduced impacts compared to those reared in ambient temperatures. This may be due to the increased developmental rate and subsequently reduced OA exposure time of embryos in the higher temperature treatment. These results indicate a substantive potential plasticity to multiple stressors during the embryonic development of this species of squid, but do not predict how this species would fare under these future ocean scenarios.},

	abstract = {The simultaneous effects of human activities in the ocean and climate change have already produced a series of responses from the marine ecosystems. With the potential increment of future human activities, such as offshore renewable energy developments, proactive management is required. To facilitate effective management and conservation actions, it is imperative to identify species potentially at risk and their critical habitats. Here we examine 16 cetacean species habitat suitability in the western North Atlantic Ocean using generalized additive models developed from data collected by NOAA- Northeast and Southeast Fisheries Science Centers from 2010 to 2017. The models were based on observed species distribution as a function of 21 environmental covariates and compare species-specific core habitats between 2010 and 2017. We identified seasonal differences in patterns of habitat change across guilds and an average northward shift of 178 km across the study area. The effects of these shifts are still unknown, but for already stressed species, the contraction or displacement of their historical habitat could worsen their population status. Therefore, the imminent development of offshore regions, in addition to the effects of climate change emphasize the need of adaptively managing ecosystems on the face of multiple challenges.},

Prior studies have broadly investigated the impacts of ocean acidification on embryonic squid, but have not addressed the thresholds at which these responses occur or their potential variability. We raised squid, Doryteuthis pealeii (captured in Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts, USA: 41°23.370'N 70°46.418′W), eggs in three trials across the breeding season (May–September, 2013) in a total of six chronic pCO2 exposures (400, 550, 850, 1300, 1900, and 2200 ppm). Hatchlings were counted and subsampled for mantle length, yolk volume, hatching time, hatching success, and statolith morphology. New methods for analysis of statolith shape, rugosity, and surface degradation were developed and are presented (with code). Responses to acidification (e.g., reduced mantle lengths, delayed hatching, and smaller, more degraded statoliths) were evident at {\textasciitilde} 1300 ppm CO2. However, patterns of physiological response and energy management, based on comparisons of yolk consumption and growth, varied among trials. Interactions between pCO2 and hatching day indicated a potential influence of exposure time on responses, while interactions with culture vessel highlighted the substantive natural variability within a clutch of eggs. While this study is consistent with, and expands upon, previous findings of sensitivity of the early life stages to acidification, it also highlights the plasticity and potential for resilience in this population of squid.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic CO2-emission is causing ocean warming and acidification. Understanding how basic physiological processes of marine organisms respond to these stressors is important for predicting their responses to future global change. We examined the effects of elevated pCO2 and temperature (pCO2 = 344–2199 ppm; temperature = 6°C, 9°C, and 12°C) on the calcification rate, extrapallial fluid (EPF) carbonate chemistry, respiration, and survivorship of Atlantic sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) in a fully crossed 143-d experiment. Rates of calcification and respiration were inhibited by elevated pCO2, and mortality occurred when elevated pCO2 was accompanied by high-temperature stress. Declines in growth and survivorship were likely caused by external shell dissolution, thermal stress, and hypercapnic reduction of metabolism under elevated pCO2. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity in the EPF increased above seawater concentrations in response to elevated pCO2. EPF pH declined, but did not decline as much as seawater pH, indicating that scallops regulate EPF pH to support calcification. The combination of EPF pH regulation and DIC elevation yielded an increase in EPF [CO32−] under elevated pCO2 treatments. The combination of low respiration rates, high EPF [CO32−], and low calcification rates under elevated pCO2 suggests that the impaired calcification arises more from hypercapnic inhibition of metabolic activity and external shell dissolution than from chemically unfavorable conditions in the EPF. These results demonstrate the importance of EPF chemistry for bivalve biomineralization, but show that regulation efforts are insufficient to fully offset the deleterious effects of elevated pCO2 on scallop performance.},

These cycles have been profoundly altered due to the emission of greenhouse gasses and other anthropogenic substances by human activities, driving pervasive changes in Earth’s climate system. In 2022, the world’s oceans, as given by OHC, were again the hottest in the historical record and exceeded the previous 2021 record maximum. According to IAP/CAS data, the 0–2000 m OHC in 2022 exceeded that of 2021 by 10.9 ± 8.3 ZJ (1 Zetta Joules = 1021 Joules); and according to NCEI/NOAA data, by 9.1 ± 8.7 ZJ. Among seven regions, four basins (the North Pacific, North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, and southern oceans) recorded their highest OHC since the 1950s. The salinity-contrast index, a quantification of the “salty gets saltier—fresh gets fresher” pattern, also reached its highest level on record in 2022, implying continued amplification of the global hydrological cycle. Regional OHC and salinity changes in 2022 were dominated by a strong La Niña event. Global upper-ocean stratification continued its increasing trend and was among the top seven in 2022.},

However, despite extensive research into the physical drivers of MHWs11,12, there has been no comprehensive global assessment of our ability to predict these events. Here we use a large multimodel ensemble of global climate forecasts13,14 to develop and assess MHW forecasts that cover the world’s oceans with lead times of up to a year. Using 30 years of retrospective forecasts, we show that the onset, intensity and duration of MHWs are often predictable, with skilful forecasts possible from 1 to 12 months in advance depending on region, season and the state of large-scale climate modes, such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. We discuss considerations for setting decision thresholds based on the probability that a MHW will occur, empowering stakeholders to take appropriate actions based on their risk profile. These results highlight the potential for operational MHW forecasts, analogous to forecasts of extreme weather phenomena, to promote climate resilience in global marine ecosystems.},

Considerable effort has been directed at understanding the patterns, drivers and trends of MHWs globally9–11. Typically, MHWs are characterized on the basis of their intensity and persistence at a given location—an approach that is particularly relevant for corals and other sessile organisms that must endure increased temperatures. However, many ecologically and commercially important marine species respond to environmental disruptions by relocating to favourable habitats, and dramatic range shifts of mobile marine species are among the conspicuous impacts of MHWs1,4,12,13. Whereas spatial temperature shifts have been studied extensively in the context of long-term warming trends14–18, they are unaccounted for in existing global MHW analyses. Here we introduce thermal displacement as a metric that characterizes MHWs by the spatial shifts of surface temperature contours, instead of by local temperature anomalies, and use an observation-based global sea surface temperature dataset to calculate thermal displacements for all MHWs from 1982 to 2019. We show that thermal displacements during MHWs vary from tens to thousands of kilometres across the world’s oceans and do not correlate spatially with MHW intensity. Furthermore, short-term thermal displacements during MHWs are of comparable magnitude to century-scale shifts inferred from warming trends18, although their global spatial patterns are very different. These results expand our understanding of MHWs and their potential impacts on marine species, revealing which regions are most susceptible to thermal displacement, and how such shifts may change under projected ocean warming. The findings also highlight the need for marine resource management to account for MHW-driven spatial shifts, which are of comparable scale to those associated with long-term climate change and are already happening.},

	abstract = {Aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) in surface and subsurface waters of the global oceans was calculated from up-to-date (through the year of 2012) ocean station dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) data. Surface Ωarag in the open ocean was always supersaturated (Ω {\textgreater} 1), ranging between 1.1 and 4.2. It was above 2.0 (2.0–4.2) between 40°N and 40°S but decreased toward higher latitude to below 1.5 in polar areas. The influences of water temperature on the TA/DIC ratio, combined with the temperature effects on inorganic carbon equilibrium and apparent solubility product (K′sp), explain the latitudinal differences in surface Ωarag. Vertically, Ωarag was highest in the surface mixed layer. Higher hydrostatic pressure, lower water temperature, and more CO2 buildup from biological activity in the absence of air-sea gas exchange helped maintain lower Ωarag in the deep ocean. Below the thermocline, aerobic decomposition of organic matter along the pathway of global thermohaline circulation played an important role in controlling Ωarag distributions. Seasonally, surface Ωarag above 30° latitudes was about 0.06 to 0.55 higher during warmer months than during colder months in the open-ocean waters of both hemispheres. Decadal changes of Ωarag in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans showed that Ωarag in waters shallower than 100 m depth decreased by 0.10 ± 0.09 (−0.40 ± 0.37\% yr−1) on average from the decade spanning 1989–1998 to the decade spanning 1998–2010.},

	abstract = {Forage fish are schooling species commonly occurring in both offshore pelagic and nearshore coastal habitats. Beyond use by some species for spawning, the dynamics of nearshore habitat use are not well understood. The objective of our study was to evaluate the spring–summer dynamics of forage fish occurrence in nearshore habitats of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. We suspected that habitat changes resulting from removal of two large dams on the Elwha River (2009–2011) may have altered fish presence and abundance. Monthly beach seine sampling in four regions along 40 km of shoreline was conducted from April to September between 2006 and 2019. We caught nearly 600,000 fish, comprising 82 different species. Nine species of forage fish accounted for 81.7\% of all fishes caught; most were classified as postlarvae and juveniles based on size. There were spatial differences in the forage fish assemblage between two of our sites but no discernable year effects and no obvious impact of dam removal on forage community composition. Three species represented 78.8\% of the catch: Pacific Herring Clupea pallasii, Pacific Sand Lance Ammodytes hexapterus, and Surf Smelt Hypomesus pretiosus. We used a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model to evaluate spatial and temporal variability in the probability of occurrence of these species. Each species exhibited a unique pattern of intra-annual, interannual, and regional fluctuations. Pacific Herring occurrence progressively increased monthly, Pacific Sand Lance occurrence decreased, and Surf Smelt probability of occurrence peaked in June. Temporal variations in distribution and abundance of these species are likely driven by life history differences and biological requirements. We speculate that specific characteristics of each region, including proximity to spawning areas, spawn timing, extant current patterns, and ecosystem processes, drove variations in distribution between species.},

	abstract = {Climate-driven distributional shifts have been well-documented for fisheries resources along the East Coast of the United States, yet little attention has been given to adjacent estuarine systems. The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the continental United States and serves as important habitat for a diversity of fishes and invertebrates, many of which are seasonal residents. Survey data indicate that relative abundance of finfish in Chesapeake Bay has diminished substantially, while coastwide stock status has remained unchanged. In response to warming, seasonal estuarine residents may remain in coastal waters or inhabit a northerly estuary, but the extent to which changing environmental conditions may drive exchange between the coastal ocean and estuarine systems remains unresolved. This study analyzed data collected from 2008 to 2019 by three fisheries-independent trawl surveys to explore temporal patterns and associated environmental drivers of the estuarine–coastal ocean exchange in the Mid-Atlantic for eight economically and ecologically important species. Relative habitat utilization of Chesapeake Bay declined for most species, while utilization patterns for Delaware Bay were largely constant or increasing over time. Broad-scale, multispecies analyses of relative habitat utilization time series revealed that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was an important driver of Chesapeake Bay exchange, but that average Apr/May coastal ocean bottom temperature was significant for Delaware Bay. Collectively, the results demonstrate that several Mid-Atlantic species have altered their estuarine habitat use over time, climate drivers associated with estuarine–coastal ocean exchange operate on different time scales, and that the impacts of warming within the Mid-Atlantic vary spatially.},

Through the course of 2019, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council developed a conceptual model of ecosystem linkages and risks for summer flounder, a species of recreational and commercial fisheries importance. The proximal aim of the model was to develop a list of integrated management questions that could be refined and addressed through a future quantitative management strategy evaluation. As such, this conceptual model served as a scoping tool. However, the true value of the conceptual model lays elsewhere: familiarizing resource managers historically focused on single-species management with the potential utility of an ecosystem approach to management. This paper details the goals and development of the conceptual model and situates this process in the broader context of best practices for collaborative open science and scientific reproducibility. Further, it highlights a successful path by which the shift towards ecosystem-based management can be actuated.},

	abstract = {The northeast United States Atlantis model (NEUSv2) is an end-to-end ecosystem model that can simulate biogeochemical, ecological, fishery, management, and socio-economic processes within marine ecosystems. As a major update to the original model, NEUSv2 includes changes to the model's functional group definitions and forcing data. NEUSv2 is the first Atlantis model to use a satellite-ocean-color-derived phytoplankton size class model that was tuned specifically for the region to force marine primary production. Additionally, physical ocean variables (currents, temperature, and salinity) were updated using a high-resolution global ocean reanalysis. Despite its coarse resolution, NEUSv2 was capable of reproducing the broad spatial patterns seen in the physical and biological forcing sources, with the exception of some circulation features. NEUSv2 produced plausible zooplankton and planktivore biomass, a stable lower trophic food web, and recent trends in zooplankton biomass. NEUSv2 meets calibration criteria for the persistence and long-term stability of functional group biomass. Given the success of this new Atlantis forcing approach, we detail the observations and challenges regarding spatial scale-related processes, data assimilation, and biological calibration. We also discuss possible tradeoffs with model scope, calibration, and the availability of feedback mechanisms. This NEUSv2 hindcast is well suited for exploring ecosystem-level sensitivity to lower trophic processes and for testing alternative biogeochemical forcing. Further developments will improve model performance for higher trophic levels.},

Based on the unstructured-grid model SCHISM, we present a new cross-scale hydrodynamic model setup for the southern North Sea, which enables high-resolution analysis of offshore wind farms in the marine environment. We introduce an observational-based empirical approach to parameterize the atmospheric wakes in a hydrodynamic model and simulate the seasonal cycle of the summer stratification in consideration of the recent state of wind farm development in the southern North Sea. The simulations show the emergence of large-scale attenuation in the wind forcing and associated alterations in the local hydro- and thermodynamics. The wake effects lead to unanticipated spatial variability in the mean horizontal currents and to the formation of large-scale dipoles in the sea surface elevation. Induced changes in the vertical and lateral flow are sufficiently strong to influence the residual currents and entail alterations of the temperature and salinity distribution in areas of wind farm operation. Ultimately, the dipole-related processes affect the stratification development in the southern North Sea and indicate potential impact on marine ecosystem processes. In the German Bight, in particular, we observe large-scale structural change in stratification strength, which eventually enhances the stratification during the decline of the summer stratification toward autumn.},

In southern New England, USA, one of the largest commercial offshore wind energy farms in the USA will be established in the waters off Massachusetts and Rhode Island, an area used by the Critically Endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. Prior to 2011, little was known about the use of this area by right whales. We examined aerial survey data collected between 2011-2015 and 2017-2019 to quantify right whale distribution, residency, demography, and movements in the region. Right whale occurrence increased during the study period. Since 2017, whales have been sighted in the area nearly every month, with peak sighting rates between late winter and spring. Model outputs suggest that 23\% of the species’ population is present from December through May, and the mean residence time has tripled to an average of 13 d during these months. Age and sex ratios of the individuals present in the area are similar to those of the species as a whole, with adult males the most common demographic group. Movement models showed that southern New England is an important destination for right whales, including conceptive and reproductive females, and qualitative observations included animals feeding and socializing. Implementing mitigation procedures in coordination with these findings will be crucial in lessening the potential impacts on right whales from construction noise, increased vessel traffic, and habitat disruption in this region.},

These impacts often exacerbate the anthropogenic stressors that habitats face, particularly in the coastal environment. We conducted a climate vulnerability assessment of 52 marine, estuarine, and riverine habitats in the Northeast U.S. to develop an ecosystem-scale understanding of the impact of climate change on these habitats. The trait-based assessment considers the overall vulnerability of a habitat to climate change to be a function of two main components, sensitivity and exposure, and relies on a process of expert elicitation. The climate vulnerability ranks ranged from low to very high, with living habitats identified as the most vulnerable. Over half of the habitats examined in this study are expected to be impacted negatively by climate change, while four habitats are expected to have positive effects. Coastal habitats were also identified as highly vulnerable, in part due to the influence of non-climate anthropogenic stressors. The results of this assessment provide regional managers and scientists with a tool to inform habitat conservation, restoration, and research priorities, fisheries and protected species management, and coastal and ocean planning.},

We then tested whether recruitment regimes coincide with regimes in the zooplankton community, and whether the abundance of large spawners could explain the patterns in recruitment. We found evidence for 3 decadal-scale recruitment regimes: low recruitment success in the 1980s, high success in the 1990s, and a return to low recruitment success in the 2000s. This general pattern was found in all datasets of recruitment. The abundance of large spawners did not appear to be a broad-scale driver of recruitment success; however, recruitment regimes coincided with regimes in copepod abundance and size structure.},

	abstract = {The degree to which evidence of range shifts in shelf biomass dominants, Atlantic surfclams and ocean quahogs, as a function of climate change is examined by comparing the dissimilarity in distribution of the living community and the record of habitation ensconced in the death assemblage. Comparison of the distribution of live animals and dead shells reveals for both species that live animals are rarely found where dead shells were not collected, but dead shells were collected at a substantively larger number of sites than where live animals were found. The geographic footprint resolved by the dead shells was much broader than that of live animals. Extensive spatially-coherent regions exist inshore and offshore of the present-day habitat of occupation where evidence of previous occupation exists. Sites where ocean quahog shells were found without live ocean quahogs included a portion of the continental shelf inshore of the present-day habitable range, an area only habitable under colder climatic conditions than observed today. Surfclam shells were found offshore of the present-day habitable region, in deeper water: additional warming of bottom waters offshore would be necessary for surfclams to occupy the region now occupied solely by dead shells. The death assemblage shows that these biomass dominants have repositioned themselves across the continental shelf during the past and this repositioning certainly is driven by changes in bottom water temperature. Moreover, the distribution of surfclam shells indicates that the death assemblage may provide a possible window into the future, as movement of the present-day population is towards these deeper-water previously-occupied regions. Overall, the death assemblage may provide an important source of information on range shifts sparing the need to carry out extensive and frequent benthic surveys and may permit reconstruction of ongoing shifts in community composition as a product of climate change when adequate survey data are not available.},

Ocean quahogs are a commercially important bivalve, inhabiting the continental shelf of the North Atlantic basin. We examined growth rates of ocean quahogs that were fully recruited to the commercial fishery ({\textgreater}80-mm shell length) from four sites covering the range of the stock along the east coast of the U.S. through analysis of annual growth lines in the hinge plate. Both geographic and temporal differences (on a scale of decadal or longer) in growth rates exist throughout the range of the stock. The age at which animals reached 60, 80, and 90 mm decreased significantly, and average growth rates to 60, 80, and 90 mm increased significantly with birth year at a New Jersey and a Long Island site, both located in the southwestern portion of the stock, since the late 1700s/early 1800s, likely in response to increasing bottom water temperatures. That is, growth rates vary temporally with birth date at the southwestern sites, with younger animals growing at a much faster rate in recent decades than those born many decades previously, whereas at the northern sites off southern New England and on Georges Bank, changes in growth rates through time are limited to older adult animals or absent altogether. Thus, at the southern portion of the range, variation in growth rate over time exists in all phases of ocean quahog life, whereas on Georges Bank, little evidence exists for any differential in growth rate over the last {\textasciitilde}200 years. The fact that ocean quahogs record the rise in ocean temperatures after the Little Ice Age in the Mid-Atlantic Bight southeast of southern New England, yet demonstrate little evidence of such a rise in the southern New England and Georges Bank region, would suggest a differential response of ocean circulation and its control of bottom water temperature between the northern and southern portions of the Mid-Atlantic Bight over the last 200+ years.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of biodiversity, or hotspots, represent conservation priorities in terrestrial ecosystems but remain largely unexplored in marine habitats. In the open ocean, many large predators such as tunas, sharks, billfishes, and sea turtles are of current conservation concern because of their vulnerability to overfishing and ecosystem role. Here we use scientific-observer records from pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to show that oceanic predators concentrate in distinct diversity hotspots. Predator diversity consistently peaks at intermediate latitudes (20–30° N and S), where tropical and temperate species ranges overlap. Individual hotspots are found close to prominent habitat features such as reefs, shelf breaks, or seamounts and often coincide with zooplankton and coral reef hotspots. Closed-area models in the northwest Atlantic predict that protection of hotspots outperforms other area closures in safeguarding threatened pelagic predators from ecological extinction. We conclude that the seemingly monotonous landscape of the open ocean shows rich structure in species diversity and that these features should be used to focus future conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Fisheries independent surveys require rethinking because of increasing spatial restrictions and interactions with offshore wind energy development (OWD). Fisheries, protected species, and environmental data collections have been conducted by scientific institutions to meet societal demands for food security, conservation, and other marine uses. These data collections provide information on key resource measures, essential for fisheries, protected species, and ecosystem management. With the increase in pace and magnitude of OWD's industrialization of marine waters, disruptions in these long-term time series can be expected. These disruptions will impact the ability to support current and future management goals and objectives. This paper presents an expert survey on the perceptions of OWD interactions with common survey designs and survey methodologies in Europe and the U.S., along with a selected sample of 75 fisheries independent surveys in the U.S. and Europe providing an initial assessment and description of potential impacts from OWD. About 72\% of the surveys sampled record interactions with operational, planned or future OWD. Four case studies demonstrate efforts to address these interactions within European regions that have operational OWD and the U.S. where development has just begun. Finally, we make recommendations for future research important to continue meaningful scientific-based management advice.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Climate change influences marine environmental conditions and is projected to increase future environmental variability. In the North Atlantic, such changes will affect the behavior and spatiotemporal distributions of large pelagic fish species (i.e., tunas, billfishes, and sharks). Generally, studies on these species have focused on specific climate-induced changes in abiotic factors separately (e.g., water temperature) and on the projection of shifts in species abundance and distribution based on these changes. In this review, we consider the latest research on spatiotemporal effects of climate-induced environmental changes to HMS’ life history, ecology, physiology, distribution, and habitat selection, and describe how the complex interplay between climate-induced changes in biotic and abiotic factors, including fishing, drives changes in species productivity and distribution in the Northwest Atlantic. This information is used to provide a baseline for investigating implications for management of pelagic longline fisheries and to identify knowledge gaps in this region. Warmer, less oxygenated waters may result in higher post-release mortality in bycatch species. Changes in climate variability will likely continue to alter the dynamics of oceanographic processes regulating species behavior and distribution, as well as fishery dynamics, creating challenges for fishery management. Stock assessments need to account for climate-induced changes in species abundance through the integration of species-specific responses to climate variability. Climate-induced changes will likely result in misalignment between current spatial and temporal management measures and the spatiotemporal distribution of these species. Finally, changes in species interactions with fisheries will require focused research to develop best practices for adaptive fisheries management and species recovery.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Tuna are globally distributed species of major commercial importance and some tuna species are a major source of protein in many countries. Tuna are characterized by dynamic distribution patterns that respond to climate variability and long-term change. Here, we investigated the effect of environmental conditions on the worldwide distribution and relative abundance of six tuna species between 1958 and 2004 and estimated the expected end-of-the-century changes based on a high-greenhouse gas concentration scenario (RCP8.5). We created species distribution models using a long-term Japanese longline fishery dataset and two-step generalized additive models. Over the historical period, suitable habitats shifted poleward for 20 out of 22 tuna stocks, based on their gravity centre (GC) and/or one of their distribution limits. On average, tuna habitat distribution limits have shifted poleward 6.5 km per decade in the northern hemisphere and 5.5 km per decade in the southern hemisphere. Larger tuna distribution shifts and changes in abundance are expected in the future, especially by the end-of-the-century (2080–2099). Temperate tunas (albacore, Atlantic bluefin, and southern bluefin) and the tropical bigeye tuna are expected to decline in the tropics and shift poleward. In contrast, skipjack and yellowfin tunas are projected to become more abundant in tropical areas as well as in most coastal countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZ). These results provide global information on the potential effects of climate change in tuna populations and can assist countries seeking to minimize these effects via adaptive management.},

However, global climate models have struggled to accurately predict this warming due to limited resolution; and past regional downscaling efforts focused on multi-decadal projections, neglecting predictive skill associated with internal variability. We address these gaps with a high resolution (1/12°) ensemble of dynamically downscaled decadal predictions. The downscaled simulations accurately predicted past oceanic variability at scales relevant to marine resource management, with skill typically exceeding global coarse-resolution predictions. Over the long term, warming of the Shelf is projected to continue; however, we forecast a temporary warming pause in the next decade. This predicted pause is attributed to internal variability associated with a transient, moderate strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and a southward shift of the Gulf Stream.},

	abstract = {Using a 1/12° regional model of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (MOM6-NWA12), we downscale an ensemble of retrospective seasonal forecasts from a 1° global forecast model. To evaluate whether downscaling improved the forecast skill for surface temperature and salinity and bottom temperature, the global and downscaled forecasts are compared with each other and with a reference forecast of persistence using anomaly correlation. Both sets of forecasts are also evaluated on the basis of mean bias and ensemble spread. We find that downscaling significantly improved the forecast skill for monthly sea surface temperature anomalies in the Northeast US Large Marine Ecosystem, a region that global models have historically struggled to skillfully predict. The downscaled sea surface temperature (SST) predictions for this region were also more skillful than the persistence baseline across most initialization months and lead times. Although some of the SST prediction skill in this region stems from the recent rapid warming trend, prediction skill above persistence is generally maintained after removing the contribution of the trend, and patterns of skill suggestive of predictable processes are also preserved. While downscaling mainly improved the SST anomaly prediction skill in the Northeast US region, it improved bottom temperature and sea surface salinity anomaly skill across many of the marine ecosystems along the North American east coast. Although improvements in anomaly prediction via downscaling were ubiquitous, the effects of downscaling on prediction bias were mixed. Downscaling generally reduced the mean surface salinity biases found in the global model, particularly in regions with sharp salinity gradients (the Northern Gulf of Mexico and the Northeast US). In some cases, however, downscaling amplified the surface and bottom temperature biases found in the global predictions. We discuss several processes that are better resolved in the regional model and contribute to the improved skill, including the autumn reemergence of temperature anomalies and advection of water masses by coastal currents. Overall, the results show that a downscaled high-resolution model can produce improved seasonal forecast skill by representing fine-scale processes that drive predictability.},

	abstract = {Intra-annual patterns of hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay have been recorded since the mid-1900s, but anthropogenic inputs and climate change have exacerbated the volume and extent of hypoxic waters, which mobile marine fishes avoid. This estuary provides important habitat for many seasonally resident species but declines in relative abundance and relative habitat usage have been documented. An understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and habitat suitability could assist in evaluating the stock status of these species. To characterize baseline habitat associations for Micropogonias undulatus, Leiostomus xanthurus, Paralichthys dentatus, and Cynoscion regalis, ecological niche models were developed relating catch-per-unit-effort data from a fisheries-independent trawl survey conducted within Chesapeake Bay to environmental covariates. Model output indicated that impacts of climate change on the environmental conditions, including continued increases in temperature and decreases in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, will likely further the decline in estuarine utilization of these species. The niche envelopes were then paired with hindcasts from an estuarine-carbon-biogeochemical regional model to derive estimates of spatiotemporal habitat suitability. The patterns in habitat suitability do not match those of declining abundance, indicating that dynamics outside of Chesapeake Bay are likely driving the shift. An auxiliary model was used to replace hypoxic DO concentrations with normoxic concentrations to evaluate the influence of hypoxia on habitat suitability. Both hypoxic severity and extent displayed significant associations with the quantity of suitable habitat available to each species in the bay. Results characterize the complexity of the dynamics underpinning observed trends in habitat utilization.},

This study investigates the changing pattern of the Gulf Stream over the last 3 decades as observed in the altimetric record (1993–2022) using monthly averaged altimetry maps together with the outputs from an ocean reanalysis product. The seasonal and yearly evolution of the coordinates (destabilization point) where the Gulf Stream starts to meander and convert from a stable to an unstable detached jet is investigated. At the seasonal scale, the location of this destabilization point presents zonal shifts displacing the Gulf Stream path to the north in summer and fall and to the south in winter and spring. In addition, it presents variations at interannual scale and has varied by more than 1400 km in longitude, showing meridional shifts of 300 km over the altimetric era: it exhibits a low-frequency remarkable shift westward and southward between 1995 and 2012. From that year, the destabilization point displacement inverses, exhibiting a previously unreported migration eastward and northward that translates into a larger fraction of the stable detached jet to the detriment of the unstable meandering jet. Changes in the Gulf Stream path impact both associated mesoscale eddy kinetic energy and waters transported towards the subpolar North Atlantic. The observed shifts of the path destabilization point seem to be linked to North Atlantic Oscillation variability during winter that may play an important role: it presents a negative trend associated with a shift from a positive to a negative phase between 1995 and 2011 and an opposite behavior from a negative to a positive phase from that year until 2020 in agreement with the associated southwestward and northeastward observed migration of the destabilization point.},

In marine fishes, warming is expected to cause the advancement of a spring peak in larval occurrence or the delay of a fall peak. However, empirical evidence has not consistently upheld this broad prediction, implying that more nuanced hypotheses are needed. Our study investigates oceanic impacts on fish phenology by examining patterns in larval occurrence on the Northeast US continental shelf, one of the most rapidly warming regions of the global ocean. We use data from NOAA’s Ecosystem Monitoring Program, which samples larval fish taxa across the shelf on a bimonthly basis. The sampling program began in 1999, thus documenting changes during a period of rapid warming. We calculated the central tendency of seasonal larval occurrence for 38 taxa and tested for temporal relationships with oceanic drivers thought to influence larval seasonality in other ecosystems. We did not find evidence for warming-related changes in larval phenology over the last 2 decades. Rather, we found high interannual variability in larval timing among many populations, especially those along the shelf break. Among examined factors, salinity maximum intrusions associated with Gulf Stream warm core rings showed the strongest explanatory power for variation in larval fish phenology. Additionally, the occurrence timing of highly variable larval populations overlapped with that of salinity maximum intrusions. Our results suggest that uniform phenological responses to warming are unlikely in this ecosystem, and that hydrodynamic processes connecting widely dispersed regions can strongly influence the phenology of fish.},

The Gulf of Maine on the Northeast U.S. Shelf is vulnerable to warming temperatures and other climate impacts, which could affect the distribution and production of plankton species sensitive to phenological shifts. In this study, we apply a novel data-driven modeling approach to long-term datasets to understand the population variability of Calanus finmarchicus, a lipid-rich copepod that is fundamental to the Gulf of Maine food web. Our results reveal how phenology impacts the complex intermingling of top-down and bottom-up controls. We find that early initiation of the annual phytoplankton bloom prompts an early start to the reproductive season for populations of C. finmarchicus in the inner Gulf of Maine, resulting in high spring abundance. This spring condition appears to be conducive to enhanced predation pressure later in the season, consequently resulting in overall low C. finmarchicus abundance in the fall. These biologically controlled dynamics are less pronounced in the outer Gulf of Maine, where water exchanges near the boundary have a greater influence. Our analysis augments existing hypotheses in fisheries oceanography and classical ecological theory by considering unique plankton life-history characteristics and shelf sea dynamics, offering new insights into the biological factors driving C. finmarchicus variability.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic warming and nutrient over-enrichment of our oceans have resulted in significant, and often catastrophic, reductions in dissolved oxygen (deoxygenation). Stress on water-breathing animals from this deoxygenation has been shown to occur at all levels of biological organization: cellular, organ, individual, species, population, community, and ecosystem. Most climate forecasts predict increases in ocean deoxygenation; thus, it is essential to develop reliable biological indicators of low-oxygen stress that can be used by regional and global oxygen monitoring efforts to detect and assess the impacts of deoxygenation on ocean life. This review focuses on responses to low-oxygen stress that are manifest at different levels of biological organization and at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. We compare particular attributes of these biological indicators to the dissolved oxygen threshold of response, timescales of response, sensitive life stages and taxa, and the ability to scale the response to oxygen stress across levels of organization. Where there is available evidence, we discuss the interactions of other biological and abiotic stressors on the biological indicators of low-oxygen stress. We address the utility, confounding effects, and implementation of the biological indicators of oxygen stress for research and societal applications. Our hope is that further refinement and dissemination of these oxygen stress indicators will provide more direct support for environmental managers, fisheries and mariculture scientists, conservation professionals, and policymakers to confront the challenges of ocean deoxygenation. An improved understanding of the sensitivity of different ocean species, communities, and ecosystems to low-oxygen stress will empower efforts to design monitoring programs, assess ecosystem health, develop management guidelines, track conditions, and detect low-oxygen events.},

	abstract = {Picophytoplankton are a ubiquitous component of marine plankton communities and are expected to be favored by global increases in seawater temperature and stratification associated with climate change. Eukaryotic and prokaryotic picophytoplankton have distinct ecology, and global models predict that the two groups will respond differently to future climate scenarios. At a nearshore observatory on the Northeast US Shelf, however, decades of year-round monitoring have shown these two groups to be highly synchronized in their responses to environmental variability. To reconcile the differences between regional and global predictions for picophytoplankton dynamics, we here investigate the picophytoplankton community across the continental shelf gradient from the nearshore observatory to the continental slope. We analyze flow cytometry data from 22 research cruises, comparing the response of picoeukaryote and Synechococcus communities to environmental variability across time and space. We find that the mechanisms controlling picophytoplankton abundance differ across taxa, season, and distance from shore. Like the prokaryote, Synechococcus, picoeukaryote division rates are limited nearshore by low temperatures in winter and spring, and higher temperatures offshore lead to an earlier spring bloom. Unlike Synechococcus, picoeukaryote concentration in summer decreases dramatically in offshore surface waters and exhibits deeper subsurface maxima. The offshore picoeukaryote community appears to be nutrient limited in the summer and subject to much greater loss rates than Synechococcus. This work both produces and demonstrates the necessity of taxon- and site-specific knowledge for accurately predicting the responses of picophytoplankton to ongoing environmental change.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, recruitment of young-of-year lobsters to benthic nursery habitats in the Gulf of Maine was regionally synchronized and exhibited correlative links with changes in the abundance of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, a foundational zooplankton species of the pelagic food web. The spatial scale at which recruitment dynamics were correlated indicated that recruitment processes were not as strongly coupled to trends in spawner abundance as might be expected, but, rather, were influenced by common, ecosystem-scale processes. Here we explored how local- and basin-scale zooplankton dynamics and oceanographic indicators in the Gulf of Maine correlated with lobster settlement indices and each other since the late 1980s. Our analysis indicates that lobster settlement trends in southwestern Gulf of Maine study areas, from Midcoast Maine to Cape Cod Bay, tend to be significantly correlated with basin-wide C. finmarchicus dynamics and the composition of waters entering the Gulf of Maine through the Northeast Channel. In contrast, lobster settlement in the northeastern Gulf, from Penobscot Bay to the Bay of Fundy, tended to correlate more strongly to C. finmarchicus variability in the Bay of Fundy region, which was distinct in earlier years but converged with the broader basin-scale processes in the latter years. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the combined effect of climate-related declines in abundance and phenological shifts of C. finmarchicus have contributed to declines in lobster settlement over the past decade, and justify further research into the mechanisms of this interaction. These changes also align with the weakening influence of cold Labrador Slope Water and strengthening effects of warm Gulf Stream waters that precipitated an ecosystem-wide regime shift in the Gulf of Maine over the past decade and may have greater implications for lobster recruitment than previously suspected.},

To determine the effect of current and future ocean warming on the distribution of five important USNES fish species (Atlantic cod [Gadus morhua], black sea bass [Centropristis striata], cunner [Tautogolabrus adspersus], spiny dogfish [Squalus acanthias], summer flounder [Paralichthys dentatus]), we applied species-specific physiological parameters from laboratory studies to calculate the Metabolic Index (MI). The MI for each species was calculated across a historical (1972–2019) and contemporary (2010–2019) climatology for each season. Broadly, the oceanic conditions in the winter and spring seasons did not limit metabolically suitable habitat for all five species, while portions of the USNES in the summer and fall seasons were metabolically unsuitable for the cold water species (Atlantic cod, cunner, spiny dogfish). The warmer water species (black sea bass, summer flounder) experienced little metabolically suitable habitat loss, which was restricted to the most southern portion of the distribution. Under a doubling of atmospheric CO2, metabolically suitable habitat is projected to decrease substantially for Atlantic cod, restricting them to the Gulf of Maine. Cunner are projected to experience similar habitat loss as Atlantic cod, with some refugia in the New York Bight, and spiny dogfish may experience habitat loss in the Southern Shelf and portions of Georges Bank. In contrast, black sea bass and summer flounder are projected to experience minimal habitat loss restricted to the southern inshore portion of the USNES. The utility of using MI for co-occurring fish species in the USNES differed, likely driven by species-specific physiology and whether the southern edge of a population occurred within the USNES.},

Working with ambient seawater, this experiment manipulated pH conditions while maintaining natural diel fluctuations and seasonal shifts in temperature. One-year-old surfclams were exposed to one of three pH conditions (ambient (control): 7.8 ± 0.07, medium: 7.51 ± 0.10, or low: 7.20 ± 0.10) in flow-through conditions for six weeks, and feeding and digestive physiology was measured after one day, two weeks, and six weeks. After six weeks of exposure to medium and low pH treatments, growth was not clearly affected, and, contrastingly, feeding and digestive physiology displayed variable responses to pH over time. Seemingly, low pH reduced feeding and absorption rates compared to both the medium treatment and ambient (control) condition; however, this response was clearer after two weeks compared to one day. At six weeks, suppressed physiological rates across both pH treatments and the ambient condition suggest thermal stress from high ambient water temperatures experienced the week prior (24–26 °C) dominated over any changes from low pH. Results from this study provide important information about reduced energy acquisition in surfclams in acidified environments and highlight the need for conducting multistressor experiments that consider the combined effects of temperature and pH stress.},

We compare ecosystem models parameterized before and after the onset of recent marine heatwaves to evaluate the cascading effects on ecosystem structure and function in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. While the ecosystem-level contribution (prey) and demand (predators) of most functional groups changed following the heatwaves, gelatinous taxa experienced the largest transformations, underscored by the arrival of northward-expanding pyrosomes. We show altered trophic relationships and energy flux have potentially profound consequences for ecosystem structure and function, and raise concerns for populations of threatened and harvested species.},

Despite its relevance, there is no long-term and sustained observational phytoplankton phenological product available for global ocean implementation. The data product presented here addresses this need through the development of phenological detection algorithms (including among other seasonal metrics, the bloom initiation, termination, duration, and amplitude timing) using satellite derived chlorophyll-a data from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative. This product provides the phenology output from three widely used bloom detection algorithms at three different spatial resolutions (4, 9 and 25 km) allowing for both regional and global-scale applications. In this study, the mean global phenology is characterised according to the three phenological detection methods and the different resolutions, which are compared to one another. In general, there is good agreement between the detection methods and between different resolutions on global scales. Regional differences are evident in coastal domains (particularly for resolution) and in regions with strong transitions between phytoplankton seasonal characteristics. This product can be used towards the development of national and global biodiversity assessments, pelagic ecosystem mapping and for monitoring change in climate sensitive regions relevant for ecosystem services.

Over time, this could cause spawning time to become decoupled from the timing of offspring food resources, a phenomenon referred to as trophic asynchrony. We used biological data, including body length, age, and gonad developmental stages collected from {\textgreater}125,000 individual Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) sampled between 59 and 73° N in 1980–2019. Combined with experimental data on oocyte growth rates, our analyses show that cod spawned progressively earlier by about a week per decade, partly due to ocean warming. It also appears that spawning time varied by more than 40 days, depending on year and spawning location. The significant plasticity in spawning time seems to be fine-tuned to the local phytoplankton spring bloom phenology. This ability to partly overcome thermal drivers and thus modulate spawning time could allow individuals to maximize fitness by closely tracking local environmental conditions important for offspring survival. Our finding highlights a new dimension for trophic match–mismatch and should be an important consideration in models used to predict phenology dynamics in a warmer climate.},

We draw from the 4th National Climate Assessment to summarize observed and projected changes to ecosystems and biodiversity, explore linkages to important ecosystem services, and discuss associated challenges and opportunities for natural resource management. We find that species are responding to climate change through changes in morphology and behavior, phenology, and geographic range shifts, and these changes are mediated by plastic and evolutionary responses. Responses by species and populations, combined with direct effects of climate change on ecosystems (including more extreme events), are resulting in widespread changes in productivity, species interactions, vulnerability to biological invasions, and other emergent properties. Collectively, these impacts alter the benefits and services that natural ecosystems can provide to society. Although not all impacts are negative, even positive changes can require costly societal adjustments. Natural resource managers need proactive, flexible adaptation strategies that consider historical and future outlooks to minimize costs over the long term.

Here, a 33-year (1982–2014) time series of daily satellite SST data was used to quantify and map spatial patterns in SST trends and phenology over this shelf. Strongest trends are over the Scotian Shelf (\&gt;0.6°C decade–1) and Gulf of Maine (\&gt;0.4°C decade–1) with weaker trends over the inner Mid-Atlantic Bight ({\textasciitilde}0.3°C decade–1). Winter (January–April) trends are relatively weak, and even negative in some areas; early summer (May–June) trends are positive everywhere, and later summer (July–September) trends are strongest ({\textasciitilde}1.0°C decade–1). These seasonal differences shift the phenology of many metrics of the SST cycle. The yearday on which specific temperature thresholds (8° and 12°C) are reached in spring trends earlier, most strongly over the Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine ({\textasciitilde} –0.5 days year–1). Three metrics defining the warmest summer period show significant trends towards earlier summer starts, later summer ends and longer summer duration over the entire study region. Trends in start and end dates are strongest ({\textasciitilde}1 day year–1) over the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf. Trends in increased summer duration are \&gt;2.0 days year–1 in parts of the Gulf of Maine. Regression analyses show that phenology trends have regionally varying links to the North Atlantic Oscillation, to local spring and summer atmospheric pressure and air temperature and to Gulf Stream position.

Between 2000 and 2009, in-season bycatch closures of prime scallop grounds resulted in economic losses over US{\textbackslash}100 million. To address this constraint, we collaborated with the scallop fishing industry to implement a bycatch avoidance program in the Nantucket Lightship harvest area in 2010. Vessels shared near real-time location information about bycatch amounts during fishing activities. We compiled the information, identified bycatch hotspots, and provided daily advisories to vessels on the fishing grounds. Catch per tow of Yellowtail and fishing effort in high bycatch regions significantly declined after the fleet received the advisories. The fleet harvested the target scallop allocation worth US{\textbackslash}40 million while catching only 32\% of the Yellowtail bycatch limit. This program continues as a collaborative, iterative approach to bycatch reduction that balances fleet objectives with conservation constraints.},

	abstract = {Abstract Temperature is an important factor in defining the habitats of marine resource species. While satellite sensors operationally measure ocean surface temperatures, we depend on in situ measurements to characterize benthic habitats. Ship-based measurements were interpolated to develop a time series of gridded spring and fall, surface and bottom temperature fields for the US Northeast Shelf. Surface and bottom temperatures have increased over the study period (1968?2018) at rates between 0.18?0.31°C per decade and over a shorter time period (2004?2018) at rates between 0.26?1.49°C per decade. A change point analysis suggests that a warming regime began in the surface waters in 2011 centered on Georges Bank and the Nantucket Shoals; in following years, most of the Northeast Shelf had experienced a shift in surface temperature. A similar analysis of bottom temperature suggests a warming regime began in 2008 in the eastern Gulf of Maine; in following years, change points in temperature occurred further to the west in the Gulf of Maine, finally reaching the Middle Atlantic Bight by 2010. The spatial pattern in bottom water warming is consistent with well-known oceanographic patterns that advect warming North Atlantic waters into the Gulf of Maine. The varying spatial and temporal progression of warming in the two layers suggests they were actuated by different sets of forcing factors. We then compared these trends and change points to responses of lower and higher trophic level organisms and identified a number of coincident shifts in distribution and biomass of key forage and fisheries species.},

Recent syntheses have concluded that trophic level1, latitude6and how phenological responses are measured7are key to determining the strength of phenological responses to climate change. However, researchers still lack a comprehensive framework that can predict responses to climate change globally and across diverse taxa. Here, we synthesize hundreds of published time series of animal phenology from across the planet to show that temperature primarily drives phenological responses at mid-latitudes, with precipitation becoming important at lower latitudes, probably reflecting factors that drive seasonality in each region. Phylogeny and body size are associated with the strength of phenological shifts, suggesting emerging asynchronies between interacting species that differ in body size, such as hosts and parasites and predators and prey. Finally, although there are many compelling biological explanations for spring phenological delays, some examples of delays are associated with short annual records that are prone to sampling error. Our findings arm biologists with predictions concerning which climatic variables and organismal traits drive phenological shifts.},

These indicators enhance the analytical capabilities within NOAA Fisheries for conducting fisheries social impact assessments and informing ecosystem-based fishery management. Building on the existing Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs), new measures of climate change vulnerability are defined for the U.S. Eastern and Gulf coasts. These new indicators are used to assess the impact of sea level rise on critical commercial fishing infrastructure and the dependence of communities on species identified as vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Examples are provided in this article to demonstrate the utility of these new indicators to policy makers and the NOAA strategic goal for building resilient coastal communities that are environmentally and economically sustainable.

	abstract = {Zooplankton biomass has been monitored on joint Norwegian-Russian surveys in late summer and autumn since the 1980s. We report here on zooplankton biomass in three size fractions ({\textless}1, 1–2, and {\textgreater} 2 mm in screen mesh opening) obtained with WP-2 plankton net (180 μm mesh size) hauled vertically over the water column from near bottom to the surface for the period 1989–2020. The number of samples (stations) collected each year has been about 100–200, with a total number of 4543 stations for the whole data set. The size composition of zooplankton reflected by the three fractions has shown remarkable stability, with about 50\% of biomass contained in the medium fraction (made up largely of Calanus species), about 1/3 in the small fraction (36\%), and 16\% in the large fraction. The depth integrated biomass was generally larger in basins compared to shallower bank areas. The temporal (interannual) pattern of change was characterized by a marked peak in biomass in 1994 and 1995 with values up to {\textgreater}20 g dry weight (dw) m−2, driven to large extent by the small size fraction. Subsequently the biomass decreased to lower values but with a divergence of relatively high values (10–15 g dw m−2) in the inflow area of Atlantic water in southwest, and low values (2–6 g dw m−2) in the central area. The difference is interpreted to reflect an increase in a second summer generation of Calanus finmarchicus in the Atlantic water and a decrease of C. glacialis in the central area. The zooplankton biomass fluctuated inversely with the biomass of the Barents Sea capelin (Mallotus villosus) stock, reflecting a top-down predation effect. However, biomass was also negatively correlated with temperature of the Atlantic water, suggesting an additional and confounding effect of climate variability and change. The decrease in biomass of the central area used as a forage area by capelin, was associated with a shift to dominance by the small size fraction. This is likely an effect of predation and could be associated with a lower trophic conversion efficiency from phytoplankton to planktivorous fish and higher trophic levels by smaller zooplankton (smaller copepods such as Pseudocalanus and others) compared to the larger Calanus species.},

A number of themes emerge: (1) the south-to-north transport of plankton in the northeast Atlantic contrasts with north-to-south transport in the western North Atlantic, which has implications for understanding population responses of C. finmarchicus to climate forcing, (2) recruitment to the youngest copepodite stages occurs during or just after the phytoplankton bloom in the east whereas it occurs after the bloom at many western sites, with up to 3.5months difference in recruitment timing, (3) the deep basin and gyre of the southern Norwegian Sea is the centre of production and overwintering of C. finmarchicus, upon which the surrounding waters depend, whereas, in the Labrador/Irminger Seas production mainly occurs along the margins, such that the deep basins serve as collection areas and refugia for the overwintering populations, rather than as centres of production, (4) the western North Atlantic marginal seas have an important role in sustaining high C. finmarchicus abundance on the nearby coastal shelves, (5) differences in mean temperature and chlorophyll concentration between the western and eastern North Atlantic are reflected in regional differences in female body size and egg production, (6) regional differences in functional responses of egg production rate may reflect genetic differences between western and eastern populations, (7) dormancy duration is generally shorter in the deep waters adjacent to the lower latitude western North Atlantic shelves than in the east, (8) there are differences in stage-specific daily mortality rates between eastern and western shelves and basins, but the survival trajectories for cohort development from CI to CV are similar, and (9) early life stage survival is much lower in regions where C. finmarchicus is found with its congeners, C. glacialis and/or C. hyperboreus. This compilation and analysis provides new knowledge for evaluation and parameterisation of population models of C. finmarchicus and their responses to climate change in the North Atlantic. The strengths and weaknesses of modeling approaches, including a statistical approach based on ecological niche theory and a dynamical approach based on knowledge of spatial population dynamics and life history, are discussed, as well as needs for further research.},

	abstract = {The lipid-rich calanoid copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, plays a critical role in the Gulf of Maine pelagic food web. Despite numerous studies over the last several decades, a clear picture of variability patterns and links with key environmental drivers remains elusive. This study applies model-based scaling and sensitivity analyses to a regional plankton dataset collected over the last four decades (1977–2017). The focus is to describe the gulf-wide spatio-temporal patterns across three major basins, and to assess the relative roles of internal population dynamics and external exchanges. For the spring stock, there is strong synchrony of interannual variability among three basins. This variability is largely driven by internal population dynamics rather than external exchanges, and the internal population dynamics are more sensitive to the change of top-down mortality regime than the bottom-up forcings. For the fall stock, the synchrony among basins weakens, and the variability is influenced by both internal mortality and external dilution loss. There appears to be no direct connection between the spring stock with either the preceding or subsequent fall stock, suggesting seasonal or sub-seasonal scales of population variability and associated drivers. The results highlight seasonally varying drivers responsible for population variability, including previously less recognized top-down control.},

A regression of the residuals of the two series from their long term trends also is significant at the 5\% level, indicating that the \%LSW at the Northeast Channel has a persistent relationship on a year-to-year basis with the NAO over the full range of variation in the NAO. The response of the \%LSW to the NAO, however, appeared substantially reduced after about 1990.

The NW and GS are geographically close and vary similarly only to the west of 71°W. Downstream of that, they rapidly diverge—and the variances of their latitudes increase by more than a factor of 2—as the GS flows past the New England Seamounts.

	abstract = {Abstract Coherent, large-scale shifts in the paths of the Gulf Stream (GS) and the Kuroshio Extension (KE) occur on interannual to decadal time scales. Attention has usually been drawn to causes for these shifts in the overlying atmosphere, with some built-in delay of up to a few years resulting from propagation of wind-forced variability within the ocean. However, these shifts in the latitudes of separated western boundary currents can cause substantial changes in SST, which may influence the synoptic atmospheric variability with little or no time delay. Various measures of wintertime atmospheric variability in the synoptic band (2–8 days) are examined using a relatively new dataset for air–sea exchange [Objectively Analyzed Air–Sea Fluxes (OAFlux)] and subsurface temperature indices of the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio path that are insulated from direct air–sea exchange, and therefore are preferable to SST. Significant changes are found in the atmospheric variability following changes in the paths of these currents, sometimes in a local fashion such as meridional shifts in measures of local storm tracks, and sometimes in nonlocal, broad regions coincident with and downstream of the oceanic forcing. Differences between the North Pacific (KE) and North Atlantic (GS) may be partly related to the more zonal orientation of the KE and the stronger SST signals of the GS, but could also be due to differences in mean storm-track characteristics over the North Pacific and North Atlantic.},

We examine the meridional variability of the separated GS path on interannual to decadal time scales as an agent for similar changes in the storm track and blocking variability at midtroposphere from 1979 to 2012. We find that periods of northerly (southerly) GS path are associated with increased (suppressed) excursions of the synoptic storm track to the northeast over the Labrador Sea and reduced (enhanced) Greenland blocking.

	abstract = {Decadal variability of carbonate chemistry variables has been studied for the open ocean using observations and models, but less is known about the variations in the coastal ocean due to observational gaps and the more complex environments. In this work, we use a Bayesian-neural-network approach to reconstruct surface carbonate chemistry variables for the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) and the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) along the North American East Coast from 1982 to 2015. The reconstructed monthly time series data suggest that the rate of fCO2 increase in the MAB (18 ± 1 μatm per decade) is faster than those in the SAB (14 ± 1 μatm per decade) and the open ocean (14 ± 1 μatm per decade). Correspondingly, pH decreases faster in the MAB. The observed stagnation in the aragonite saturation state, Ωarag decrease during 2005–2015 in the MAB, is attributed to the intrusion of water from southern and offshore regions with high Ωarag, which offsets the decrease expected from anthropogenic CO2 uptake. Furthermore, seasonal asymmetry in the evolution of long-term change leads to the faster change in the amplitudes of the seasonal cycle in carbonate chemistry variables in coastal waters than those in the open ocean. In particular, the increase in the seasonal-cycle amplitude of dissolved inorganic carbon in the MAB is 2.9 times larger than that of the open ocean. This leads to the faster increase in the season-cycle amplitude of Ωarag and earlier occurrence of undersaturation in coastal waters as acidification continues.},

	abstract = {Coastal and ocean acidification has the potential to cause significant environmental and societal impacts. Monitoring carbonate chemistry parameters over spatial and temporal scales is challenging, especially with limited resources. A lack of monitoring data can lead to a limited understanding of real-world conditions. Without such data, robust experimental and model design is challenging, and the identification and understanding of episodic acidification events is nearly impossible. We present considerations for resource managers, academia, and industry professionals who are currently developing acidification monitoring programs in the Mid-Atlantic region. We highlight the following considerations for deliberation: 1) leverage existing infrastructure to include multiple carbonate chemistry parameters as well as other water quality measurements, 2) direct monitoring efforts in subsurface waters rather than limiting monitoring to surface waters, 3) identify the best available sensor technology for long-term, in-situ monitoring, 4) monitor across a salinity gradient to account for the complexity of estuarine, coastal, and ocean environments, and identify potential areas of enhanced vulnerability, 5) increase sampling frequency to capture variability, 6) consider other drivers (e.g., freshwater discharge, nutrients, physiochemical parameters) that may affect acidification, and 7) conduct or continue monitoring in specific ecological and general regions that may have enhanced vulnerability. Through the incorporation of these considerations, individual monitoring programs can more efficiently and effectively leverage resources and build partnerships for a more comprehensive data collection in the region. While these considerations focus on the Mid-Atlantic region), similar strategies can be used to leverage resources in other locations.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification represents a threat to marine species worldwide, and forecasting the ecological impacts of acidification is a high priority for science, management, and policy. As research on the topic expands at an exponential rate, a comprehensive understanding of the variability in organisms' responses and corresponding levels of certainty is necessary to forecast the ecological effects. Here, we perform the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date by synthesizing the results of 228 studies examining biological responses to ocean acidification. The results reveal decreased survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of mollusk larvae, but suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages is not universal across all taxonomic groups. In addition, the variability in species' responses is enhanced when they are exposed to acidification in multi-species assemblages, suggesting that it is important to consider indirect effects and exercise caution when forecasting abundance patterns from single-species laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the results suggest that other factors, such as nutritional status or source population, could cause substantial variation in organisms' responses. Last, the results highlight a trend towards enhanced sensitivity to acidification when taxa are concurrently exposed to elevated seawater temperature.},

We evaluated the trophic guild structure in an assemblage of 40 fish species in the Northeast United States shelf ecosystem using a 25 yr database of food habits. We explicitly accounted for ontogenetic diet shifts by separating predator species into size classes. There were 14 significant trophic guilds. These distinguished predators based upon prey size and location in the water column (i.e., benthic to pelagic feeding). Ontogenetic diet shifts were important in guild structure, particularly within dominant piscivores. The mean dietary overlap both between and within guilds was notably lower than in other fish communities due to the broad spatial and temporal scale of the study, the diversity of prey types consumed, and the generalist nature of predators in this system. The guild concept is a useful framework to simplify highly connected, complex ecosystems like the Northeast US continental shelf and identify ecologically similar functional units.},

reconnaissance flights in Maine, New Hampshire, and New York to look for newly established
sites. Two image processing approaches were taken: the first created layers of individual seals on
a base-map satellite image of the islands, while the second marked individual seals on large,
stitched images. We counted a total of 6,469 pups and 7,890 adults which produced a population
estimate of 27,911 gray seals in U.S. waters and a minimum population estimate of 23,624. We
also fit an autoregressive state-space model to calculate pup growth rates at 4 sites, 3 in
Massachusetts (Monomoy Island, Muskeget Island, and Nomans Land) and 1 in Maine (Seal

the sites and a pattern of rapid growth early in recolonization that then slowed over time.},

We considered the spatial requirements of energy developers and the spatial autocorrelation of resident species as a means to inform survey mitigation. The spatial requirements of the NES wind industry were considered in respect to the delineation of settled lease areas. We suggest access metrics ranging from 8 to 21 km representing the interquartile range of chord distances across the settled lease areas. Using survey data and concentrating on commercial species with stock assessment requirements, we computed indices of spatial autocorrelation. Tests of spatial autocorrelation using Moran’s I and join counts statistics were significant (p \&lt; 0.05) for most species, suggesting a high level of spatial correlation in their distributions. To characterize a scalar extent of spatial correlation, variograms were fit to estimate the physical range of correlated catches. These data suggest most species were spatially correlated well beyond the distance metrics derived from the lease area shapes. Sampling by a range of gears has the potential of producing spatially accurate depictions of species distributions and abundance despite the restrictions wind lease areas may place on sampling designs.},

We found records of 24,831 bounties paid in Maine (1891–1945) and 15,690 in Massachusetts (1888–1962). Considering possible fraud, missing data, and seals struck and lost, this suggests that 72,284 to 135,498 seals were killed in the bounty hunt, probably enough to account for regional declines in seal populations.

	abstract = {As the world develops sources of renewable energy, there is an intensifying interest in offshore wind energy production. The Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf (NES) ecosystem has favorable wind dynamics, with active development of wind energy. In this study, we present species distribution models that consider both occupancy and biomass responses for a broad spectrum of fish and macroinvertebrate taxa (n = 177). Building upon prior analyses, habitat was differentiated into overall and core habitats based on statistical distributions of habitat scores. Overall habitat was used to show each species' regional distribution based on fishery-independent survey captures between 1976 and 2019, whereas core habitat represented where the focus of the species' abundance was located as a subset of overall habitat. Wind energy developments may modify the water column in ways that impact lower-trophic-level productivity; therefore, added attention was given to the response of forage species. Over 20\% of species showed preferential use of putative and potential wind development areas, including a disproportionate number of forage taxa. Principal usage varied by season, with forage species like Atlantic Menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus and Atlantic Mackerel Scomber scombrus preferentially using the lease areas in spring and Round Herring Etrumeus teres and longfin inshore squid Doryteuthis pealeii using lease areas in autumn. For species with relatively low usage of the lease areas, there was a tendency for the usage related to overall habitat to be lower than usage for core habitat; in contrast, for species with high usage of the lease areas, that usage was higher for overall habitat than for core habitat. The area of habitat tended to have positive trends across species, with these positive trends being disproportionately higher among forage taxa. These results frame the importance of wind lease areas for species in the NES, particularly forage taxa that fulfill many important ecological functions.},

	abstract = {In the northeast United States, groundfish landings have declined almost continually since 1983. Fresh groundfish processors have redeployed their marketing capital by substituting other seafood products in place of regional groundfish and expanding into different markets. Meanwhile, northeast U.S. Atlantic sea scallop landings sharply increased starting in 1998, peaked in 2004, remained relatively constant until declining in 2013 and 2014. In order to leverage their favorable access to increased landings, scallop processors invested in development of new products, such as individually quick frozen (IQF) scallops, and invested in marketing activities to attract new customers, including those located in foreign nations. This behavior is consistent with Montgomery and Wernerfelt's theory of diversification in response to excess capacity of firm-specific resources and investments in product development and marketing in firm specific resources. Price and quantity indicators were used to examine the effects of shifting landings and composition of landings on exvessel values. These indicators show that declines in groundfish exvessel values were driven by declining quantities, which is consistent with processors substituting other products rather than biding up exvessel prices. Increases in scallop exvessel values were driven by both increasing prices for all sizes and by increasing quantities for large scallops, which is consistent with investment in marketing for larger scallops.},

	abstract = {Dams challenge Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) conservation, while hatcheries are a common but poorly evaluated recovery tool. We developed a spatially explicit smolt survival model for the Penobscot River, Maine, USA, population. By partitioning survival through dams (with flow dependency), free-flowing river reaches, and the estuary (with dam dependency), the model quantified how these factors influenced the number of fish entering the ocean. Given historical impounded conditions, 74\%–22\% of hatchery smolts released entered the ocean annually from 1970 to 2012. Of 19.7 million smolts stocked, 7.7 million entered the ocean (39\%). Survival was most variable at dams (range 95\% to 63\%), followed by in-river (range 98\% to 70\%) and estuary (range 88\% to 82\%). Overall, lower-river stocking sites resulted in significantly higher numbers at ocean entry because of fewer dam encounters and shorter migrations. Higher flows also resulted in reduced losses. By reconstructing these freshwater and estuary dynamics, the model provides a more accurate estimate of ocean recruitment annually and can be used for scenario planning of future stocking locations relative to predicted flows while being adaptable to new survival rates.},

	abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been observed around the world and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia ‘Ningaloo Niño’ in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena.},

The \%DWM and \%DWL were good proxies for energy density (r2 {\textgreater} 0.96) and more strongly related to K, Kn, and SMI than to BIA metrics. Principal component analysis indicated many metrics performed similarly across species; some were confounded by size, sex, and maturity along PC1, while others effectively characterized condition along PC2. Stock differences were along PC1 in winter flounder, reflecting different sizes across stocks, whereas in yellowtail flounder differences occurred along PC2 related to condition. These comparisons, within and across species, highlight the broad applicability of some metrics and limitations in others.},

	abstract = {Development of forecasting systems for harmful algal blooms (HABs) has been a long-standing research and management goal. Significant progress has been made in the Gulf of Maine, where seasonal bloom forecasts are now being issued annually using Alexandrium fundyense cyst abundance maps and a population dynamics model developed for that organism. Thus far, these forecasts have used terms such as “significant”, “moderately large” or “moderate” to convey the extent of forecasted paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) outbreaks. In this study, historical shellfish harvesting closure data along the coast of the Gulf of Maine were used to derive a series of bloom severity levels that are analogous to those used to define major storms like hurricanes or tornados. Thirty-four years of PSP-related shellfish closure data for Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire were collected and mapped to depict the extent of coastline closure in each year. Due to fractal considerations, different methods were explored for measuring length of coastline closed. Ultimately, a simple procedure was developed using arbitrary straight-line segments to represent specific sections of the coastline. This method was consistently applied to each year’s PSP toxicity closure map to calculate the total length of coastline closed. Maps were then clustered together statistically to yield distinct groups of years with similar characteristics. A series of categories or levels was defined (“Level 1: Limited”, “Level 2: Moderate”, and “Level 3: Extensive”) each with an associated range of expected coastline closed, which can now be used instead of vague descriptors in future forecasts. This will provide scientifically consistent and simply defined information to the public as well as resource managers who make decisions on the basis of the forecasts.},

	abstract = {For the period 2005–2009, the abundance of resting cysts in bottom sediments from the preceding autumn was a first-order predictor of the overall severity of spring–summer blooms of Alexandrium fundyense in the western Gulf of Maine and southern New England. Cyst abundance off mid-coast Maine was significantly higher in autumn 2009 than it was preceding a major regional bloom in 2005. A seasonal ensemble forecast was computed using a range of forcing conditions for the period 2004–2009, suggesting that a large bloom was likely in the western Gulf of Maine in 2010. This did not materialize, perhaps because environmental conditions in spring–summer 2010 were not favorable for growth of A. fundyense. Water mass anomalies indicate a regional-scale change in circulation with direct influence on A. fundyense's niche. Specifically, near-surface waters were warmer, fresher, more stratified, and had lower nutrients than during the period of observations used to construct the ensemble forecast. Moreover, a weaker-than-normal coastal current lessened A. fundyense transport into the western Gulf of Maine and Massachusetts Bay. Satellite ocean color observations indicate the 2010 spring phytoplankton bloom was more intense than usual. Early season nutrient depletion may have caused a temporal mismatch with A. fundyense's endogenous clock that regulates the timing of cyst germination. These findings highlight the difficulties of ecological forecasting in a changing oceanographic environment, and underscore the need for a sustained observational network to drive such forecasts.},

	abstract = {In July 2009, an unusually intense bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella occurred in the Gulf of Maine. The bloom reached high concentrations (from hundreds of thousands to one million cells L−1) that discolored the water and exceeded normal bloom concentrations by a factor of 1000. Using Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) imagery processed to target chlorophyll concentrations ({\textgreater}2 µg L−1), patches of intense A. catenella concentration were identified that were consistent with the highly localized cell concentrations observed from ship surveys. The bloom patches were generally aligned with the edge of coastal waters with high-absorption. Dense bloom patches moved onshore in response to a downwelling event, persisted for approximately one week, then dispersed rapidly over a few days and did not reappear. Coupled physical-biological model simulations showed that wind forcing was an important factor in transporting cells onshore. Upward swimming behavior facilitated the horizontal cell aggregation, increasing the simulated maximum depth-integrated cell concentration by up to a factor of 40. Vertical convergence of cells, due to active swimming of A. catenella from the subsurface to the top layer, could explain the additional 25-fold intensification (25 × 40=1000-fold) needed to reach the bloom concentrations that discolored the water. A model simulation that considered upward swimming overestimated cell concentrations downstream of the intense aggregation. This discrepancy between model and observed concentrations suggested a loss of cells from the water column at a time that corresponded to the start of encystment. These results indicated that the joint effect of upward swimming, horizontal convergence, and wind-driven flow contributed to the red water event, which might have promoted the sexual reproduction event that preceded the encystment process.},

Hydrographic measurements and comparisons with GOM climatology indicate that 2006 was a year with normal coastal water temperature, salinity, current and river runoff conditions. A. fundyense cyst abundance in bottom sediments preceding the 2006 bloom was at a moderate level compared to other recent annual cyst survey data. We used the coupled bio-physical model to hindcast coastal circulation and A. fundyense cell concentrations. Field data including water temperature, salinity, velocity time series and surface A. fundyense cell concentration maps were applied to gauge the model's fidelity. The coupled model is capable of reproducing the hydrodynamics and the temporal and spatial distributions of A. fundyense cell concentration reasonably well. Model hindcast solutions were further used to diagnose physical and biological factors controlling the bloom dynamics. Surface wind fields modulated the bloom's horizontal and vertical distribution. The initial cyst distribution was found to be the dominant factor affecting the severity and the interannual variability of the A. fundyense bloom. Initial cyst abundance for the 2006 bloom was about 50\% of that prior to the 2005 bloom. As the result, the time-averaged gulf-wide cell concentration in 2006 was also only about 60\% of that in 2005. In addition, weaker alongshore currents and episodic upwelling-favorable winds in 2006 reduced the spatial extent of the bloom as compared with 2005.},

	abstract = {Coastal waters of the northeastern U.S. are subject to recurrent outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) caused by toxic dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium. PSP is not uniform across the large region, but instead reflects Alexandrium growth and toxin accumulation in five separate habitats or zones defined by circulation patterns and the discontinuous distribution of the dinoflagellates. Each of these habitats has a unique set of environmental and oceanographic forcings that determine the timing and extent of bloom development and transport and that regulate the extent of genetic exchange with adjacent populations. Several habitats (e.g. the southwestern Gulf of Maine, Massachusetts Bay, and Georges Bank) are linked hydrographically and may share the same Alexandrium population via large-scale transport in a. coastal current, whereas the other two habitats (eastern Maine and southern salt ponds-embayments) seem to be isolated and have little or no hydrographic or genetic linkage to adjacent regions during bloom seasons. My paper provides an overview of the regional ecology and oceanography of Alexandrium through a focus on these five subpopulations. Issues that relate to PSP and Alexandrium dynamics throughout the world are highlighted, including species dispersal, the role of cysts and “initiation zones” in bloom development, and the influence of large- and small-scale hydrography on population development and transport. The ability of Alexandrium to colonize multiple habitats and to persist over a large region is emphasized in recognition of the adaptability and resilience of this important organism.},

	abstract = {Three different molecular methods were used with traditional brightfield microscope techniques to enumerate the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense in samples collected in the Gulf of Maine in 1998, 2000, 2001, and 2003. Two molecular probes were used in fluorescent whole-cell (WC) microscopic assays: a large-subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) oligonucleotide probe (NA1) and a monoclonal antibody probe thought to be specific for Alexandrium spp. within the tamarense/catenella/fundyense complex. Cell abundance estimates also were obtained using the NA1 oligonucleotide probe in a semi-quantitative sandwich hybridization assay (SHA) that quantified target rRNA in cell lysates. Here we compare and contrast the specificity and utility of these probe types and assay approaches. WC counts of the 1998 field samples demonstrated that A. fundyense cell densities estimated using the antibody approach were higher than those using either the NA1 oligonucleotide or brightfield microscopy due to the co-occurrence of A. ostenfeldii with A. fundyense, and the inability of the antibody to discriminate between these two species. An approach using cell size and the presence or absence of food vacuoles allowed more accurate immunofluorescent cell counts of both species, but small cells of A. ostenfeldii that did not contain food vacuoles were still mistakenly counted as A. fundyense. For 2001, a dual-labeling procedure using two oligonucleotide probes was used to separately enumerate A. ostenfeldii and A. fundyense in the WC format. In addition, the SHA was used in 2001 and 2003 to enumerate A. fundyense. Some agreement was observed between the two oligonucleotide methods, but there were differences as well. Not including samples with cell numbers below empirically determined detection limits of 25cellsl–1, good correlation was observed for surface samples and vertical profiles in May 2001 and June 2003 when the SHA estimates were, on average, equivalent, and 1.5× the WC counts, respectively. The worst correlations were for virtually all samples from the June 2001 cruise where the SHA both over- and under-estimated the WC counts. Some differences were expected, since the SHA and the WC assays measure different, but related parameters. The former quantifies intact cells and particulate material that might contain non-viable cells or fragments, whereas the latter measures only intact cells that survive sample processing and are visible in a sample matrix. A variety of factors can thus affect results, particularly with the WC method, including variable uptake of the oligonucleotide probe due to cell permeability changes, cell lysis during sampling, preservation and processing; variable rRNA content or accessibility due to nutritional or environmental factors; and the variable detection of intact cells or cell fragments in fecal pellets and detritus. The SHA offers dramatic increases in sample throughput, but introduces uncertainties, such as those due to sample matrix effects (non-specific labeling and cross-reactions), variable rRNA levels in intact cells or to the possible presence of target rRNA in cell fragments, fecal pellets, or detritus. Molecular probes are powerful tools for monitoring and research applications, but more work is needed to compare and refine these different cell enumeration methods on field samples, as well as to assess the general validity of brightfield or fluorescent WC approaches.},

	abstract = {Pseudo-nitzschia harmful algal blooms have recently caused elevated domoic acid in coastal environments of the Northeast United States. In 2017, the toxigenic species P. australis was observed in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, a temperate estuarine ecosystem, for the first time since 2009 when DNA monitoring for Pseudo-nitzschia species began. This highly toxic species likely contributed to toxin-related shellfish harvest closures and is hypothesized to have been introduced by an offshore source. Little is known about offshore Pseudo-nitzschia spp. populations in the Northeast Continental Shelf marine ecosystem or how often toxigenic species enter Narragansett Bay through physical processes. Here, we collected filtered biomass samples from multiple time series sites within Narragansett Bay and along the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research transect in winter and summer to investigate the frequency and seasonality of potential Pseudo-nitzschia spp. inflow from the continental shelf to the estuary. Species were taxonomically identified using DNA sequencing of the ITS1 region and domoic acid concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and multiple reaction monitoring. During six years of sampling, Pseudo-nitzschia species assemblages were more similar between Narragansett Bay and the Northeast shelf in winter than summer, suggesting greater ecosystem connectivity in winter. These winter assemblages were often accompanied by higher domoic acid. Several Pseudo-nitzschia species co-occurred most often with domoic acid and were likely responsible for toxin production in this region, including P. pungens var. pungens, P. multiseries, P. calliantha, P. plurisecta, P. australis, and P. fraudulenta. Domoic acid was detected during periods of relatively low macronutrient concentrations in both seasons, warmer sea surface temperatures in winter, and colder temperatures in summer within this dataset. This study represents some of the first domoic acid measurements on the offshore Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf, a region that supplies water to other coastal environments and could seed future harmful algal blooms. The elevated domoic acid and frequency of hypothesized inflow of toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. from the Northeast continental shelf to Narragansett Bay in winter indicate the need to monitor coastal and offshore environments for toxins and harmful algal bloom taxa during colder months.},

New discoveries are changing paradigms about these calciﬁers. A new role for silicon in coccolithophore calciﬁcation is coupling carbonate and silicon cycles. Phosphorus and iron play key roles in regulating coccolithophore growth. Comparing molecular phylogenies with coccolith morphometrics is forcing the reconciliation of biological and geological observations. Mixotrophy may be a possible life strategy for deep-dwelling species, which has ramiﬁcations for biological pump and alkalinity pump paradigms. Climate, ocean temperatures, and pH appear to be affecting coccolithophores in unexpected ways. Global calciﬁcation is approximately 1–3\% of primary productivity and affects CO2 budgets. New measurements of the backscattering cross section of coccolithophores have improved satellite-based algorithms and their application in case I and case II optical waters. Remote sensing has allowed the detection of basin-scale coccolithophore features in the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. “joint species distribution” or “multispecies occupancy” models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed “biogenic habitat”) improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

We suggest directions to better quantify and monitor future plankton phenology shifts, including (i) examining the main mode of expected future changes (ecological shifts in timing and spatial distribution to accommodate fixed environmental niches vs. evolutionary adaptation of timing controls to maintain fixed biogeography and seasonality), (ii) broader understanding of phenology at the species and community level (e.g. for zooplankton beyond Calanus and for phytoplankton beyond chlorophyll), (iii) improving and diversifying statistical metrics for indexing timing and trophic synchrony and (iv) improved consideration of spatio-temporal scales and the Lagrangian nature of plankton assemblages to separate time from space changes.},

Analyses support, in part, conclusions drawn by others that the Gulf of Maine has warmed and continues to warm as a result of long-term and shorter term air-sea heat fluxes. We show that warming is to a large extent a result of changes in advective heat fluxes via lateral exchanges with water masses in neighboring shelf and slope regions (Warm Slope Water and Scotian Shelf Water). Water properties of the source waters and their inflows to the Gulf have been shown to have been changing over time, and now reveal a mix that includes warm, salty, low nutrient Gulf Stream Water. The result is a new baseline in the Gulf of Maine, of warmer temperatures and higher salinities, which appears to have become established after 2010. Annual cycles of spring-to summer water column warming and fall-to-winter cooling and convective mixing are presented and discussed, showing that the maximum depth of convective mixing in the eastern interior Gulf of Maine does not usually exceed 150 m, a depth constrained by the presence a strong vertical density gradient created by layer of high salinity bottom waters. Approximately-six months after the annual late-summer influx to the Gulf of warm and salty water masses at depth and along the bottom, a mass of cold, low salinity Scotian Shelf Water arrives in the upper water layers in winter – these two major water mass fluxes are a half year out of phase with one another, every year. We suggest that these two water mass intrusion events are linked – that the winter-spring inflow of Scotian Shelf Water creates a barotropic pressure gradient in the Gulf that persists into the summer, thereby impeding the inflow of warm and salty Slope, and/or Gulf Stream Water, until that Scotian Shelf Water mass has become sufficiently dispersed in late summer, thereby effectively opening a valve that allows warm and salty deep waters from outside the Gulf to penetrate.},

The lipid accumulation window (LAW) hypothesis proposes that a seasonal window of environmental conditions allows developing individuals to store enough lipids for dormancy to be safely initiated. Successful dormancy requires a sufficient amount of lipids to fulfil the reduced metabolic demand of the dormant individual and to sustain the final maturation process. We used a pattern-oriented modelling approach that implements the LAW hypothesis and employs a genetic algorithm for parameter estimation, in order to reproduce the observed phenology and demography of C. finmarchicus populations from the two contrasting regions, the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) and the Gulf of Maine (GoM) in the northwest Atlantic shelf. In the GSL, the model reproduced the timing of dormancy, the abundance and individual condition of late copepodid stages. In the GoM, the model produced a semi-annual dormancy pattern, as no locally produced individual could last the 6–8 months of dormancy inferred from the available observations. Further testing requires extending demographic time series, including lipid condition of late copepodid stages in the GoM, and the implementation of a 3-D modelling framework that would explicitly address the complex interactions between circulation and population dynamics of C. finmarchicus over the entire northwest Atlantic shelf.},

	abstract = {The variability of zooplankton populations is controlled by external and internal forcing, with the former being principally large-scale changes in circulation, and the latter being driven by in situ growth, competition, and predation. Assessing the relative importance of these forcings is challenging and requires analyses of multifaceted observational data. As part of the U.S. GLOBEC Georges Bank program, a series of cruises were conducted in fall 1997, 1998, and 1999 to survey diapausing populations of Calanus finmarchicus and their predators in Wilkinson, Jordan, and Georges Basins of the Gulf of Maine. Station and underway sampling were conducted using net (1 m2 MOCNESS) and bioacoustic (BIOMAPER-II) systems, respectively, to acquire vertically stratified data for zooplankton biomass, taxonomic, size, and life-stage composition, together with associated environmental data. The results show that the autumn diapausing C. finmarchicus abundance was much lower in 1998 than in 1997 or 1999, even though the overall zooplankton biomass levels were comparable between the three years. The size frequency distribution of the diapausing individuals had a bi-modal pattern in 1997 and 1999, but a single mode in 1998, indicating the demise of an early cohort of the diapausing stock. The relative biomass and computed energy demand of potential invertebrate predators (euphausiids, decapods, medusae, and siphonophores) was found to be higher in 1998 and could account for the missing C. finmarchicus cohort. Evidence collected from this study supports the hypothesis that local predation has the potential to control the diapausing stock of C. finmarchicus in the Gulf of Maine.},

	abstract = {A comparative study of the mesozooplankton in four North Atlantic basins is presented. During a trans-Atlantic expedition with R/V G.O. Sars in May and June 2013, the Norwegian Sea, Iceland Sea, Irminger Sea and Labrador Sea was surveyed twice on a round trip from Bergen, Norway to Nuuk, Greenland. Mesozooplankton samples of biomass, species composition and vertical distribution were obtained with WP2 and MOCNESS plankton nets, in addition to in situ data obtained from a Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) and Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) mounted on a submersible towed vehicle. Size-fractionated biomass samples showed that the Norwegian Sea had the highest biomass of small mesozooplankton (180–1000 μm), while Irminger and Iceland Seas had the highest biomass of the medium (1000–2000 μm) and largest ({\textgreater}2000 μm) size fractions, respectively. The Icelandic Sea large fraction biomass was dominated by Amphipods, Chaetognaths, Krill and Calanus hyperboreus. The Labrador Sea had the lowest total mesozooplankton biomass. A total of 9 different species/groups were found to comprise the 5 most numerically dominant species/groups across all basins, with Oithona spp. being the most common genus in all basins. C. finmarchicus was, as expected, found to be the most numerically common species of the Calanus complex in all basins, but the stage composition varied markedly between basins with young copepodite stages dominating only in the Labrador and central Norwegian Seas. In terms of both abundance and biomass, the Iceland Sea had a higher fraction of dominating mesozooplankton distributed below 200 m. The highest average particle density per 25 m interval was registered in the Norwegian Sea during daytime between 25-50 m (OPC data). In the Labrador and Irminger Seas, total estimated particle densities in the upper 50 m were lower and the particle densities peaked at intermediate sizes (1–3 mm). In all basins there were differences in the particle densities estimated between day and night. Based on VPR data, the Irminger and Iceland Seas had the highest density of copepods registered in the upper 200 m, whereas in the Labrador Sea, the highest average copepod densities were registered at depth. Densities of gelatinous organisms were at least an order of magnitude higher in the Labrador and Irminger Seas than in the Iceland Sea.},

This study provides 2 years of baseline data on cetacean species’ presence, vessel activity, and ambient sound levels in the southern New England wind energy area. With eight species/families present in the area for at least 9 months of the year, this area represents an important habitat for cetaceans. Most species showed seasonality, with peak daily presence in winter (harbour porpoise, North Atlantic right, fin, and humpback whales), summer (sperm whales), spring (sei whales), or spring and fall/autumn (minke whales). Delphinids were continuously present and blue whales present only in January. The endangered North Atlantic right whales were present year round with high presence in October through April. Daily vessel presence showed an increase from summer through fall/autumn. On average, ambient sound levels were lowest in summer and increased late 2021 through 2022 with most temporal variability occurring across lower frequencies. The area showed a complex soundscape with several species sharing time–frequency space as well as overlap of vessel noise with the communication range of all baleen whale species.},

In the oceans, marine heatwaves (MHWs)—discrete periods of anomalously warm water—have intensified and become more frequent over the past century, impacting the integrity of marine ecosystems globally. We review and synthesize current understanding of MHW impacts at the individual, population, and community levels. We then examine how these impacts affect broader ecosystem services and discuss the current state of research on biological impacts of MHWs. Finally, we explore current and emergent approaches to predicting the occurrence andimpacts of future events, along with adaptation and management approaches. With further increases in intensity and frequency projected for coming decades, MHWs are emerging as pervasive stressors to marine ecosystems globally. A deeper mechanistic understanding of their biological impacts is needed to better predict and adapt to increased MHW activity in the Anthropocene.},

	abstract = {Humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae populations have exhibited higher local abundance in parts of the Gulf of Maine in recent years, a region that is heavily impacted by both climate change and other anthropogenic effects. The Gulf of Maine is one of the most rapidly warming ecosystems in the ocean, and humpback whales use the region to feed, suggesting that there may be interactions between humpback whales, climate, and prey species in this region. We sought to understand how humpback whale densities and distributions are changing in this area in the context of prey and the environment, focusing on a particular conservation area with ample survey coverage, the Great South Channel Habitat Management Area. We used data from 16 yr of overlapping humpback whale, fish, and invertebrate surveys to relate changing humpback whale densities to environmental covariates as well as fish and invertebrate biomass. We found that humpback whale densities are increasing in the Great South Channel faster than in the surrounding area, and these increases are related to increasing biomass of squid, small gadids, and crabs and lobsters; warming temperatures; and decreasing salinity. Sand lance and herring, 2 common humpback whale prey species, decreased in this area during the study period. These interactions between humpback whales, temperature, and fish and invertebrate species could signify that increases in humpback densities are related to both biotic and abiotic variables and suggests that this conservation area may be effective at promoting the biomass of a variety of trophic levels.},

The SYR also draws on the findings of the two Special Reports brought out in 2011 dealing with Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation, and Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation. The SYR, therefore, is a comprehensive up-to-date compilation of assessments dealing with climate change, based on the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic literature in the field.},

	abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment of projected global and regional ocean temperature change is based on global climate models that have coarse ( 100 km) ocean and atmosphere resolutions. In the Northwest Atlantic, the ensemble of global climate models has a warm bias in sea surface temperature due to a misrepresentation of the Gulf Stream position; thus, existing climate change projections are based on unrealistic regional ocean circulation. Here we compare simulations and an atmospheric CO2 doubling response from four global climate models of varying ocean and atmosphere resolution. We find that the highest resolution climate model ( 10 km ocean,  50 km atmosphere) resolves Northwest Atlantic circulation and water mass distribution most accurately. The CO2 doubling response from this model shows that upper-ocean (0–300 m) temperature in the Northwest Atlantic Shelf warms at a rate nearly twice as fast as the coarser models and nearly three times faster than the global average. This enhanced warming is accompanied by an increase in salinity due to a change in water mass distribution that is related to a retreat of the Labrador Current and a northerly shift of the Gulf Stream. Both observations and the climate model demonstrate a robust relationship between a weakening Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and an increase in the proportion of Warm-Temperate Slope Water entering the Northwest Atlantic Shelf. Therefore, prior climate change projections for the Northwest Atlantic may be far too conservative. These results point to the need to improve simulations of basin and regional-scale ocean circulation.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Northeast Continental Shelf marine ecosystem has warmed much faster than the global ocean and it is expected that this enhanced warming will continue through this century. Complex bathymetry and ocean circulation in this region have contributed to biases in global climate model simulations of the Shelf waters. Increasing the resolution of these models results in reductions in the bias of future climate change projections and indicates greater warming than suggested by coarse resolution climate projections. Here, we used a high-resolution global climate model and historical observations of species distributions from a trawl survey to examine changes in the future distribution of suitable thermal habitat for various demersal and pelagic species on the Shelf. Along the southern portion of the shelf (Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank), a projected 4.1 °C (surface) to 5.0 °C (bottom) warming of ocean temperature from current conditions results in a northward shift of the thermal habitat for the majority of species. While some southern species like butterfish and black sea bass are projected to have moderate losses in suitable thermal habitat, there are potentially significant increases for many species including summer flounder, striped bass, and Atlantic croaker. In the north, in the Gulf of Maine, a projected 3.7 °C (surface) to 3.9 °C (bottom) warming from current conditions results in substantial reductions in suitable thermal habitat such that species currently inhabiting this region may not remain in these waters under continued warming. We project a loss in suitable thermal habitat for key northern species including Acadian redfish, American plaice, Atlantic cod, haddock, and thorney skate, but potential gains for some species including spiny dogfish and American lobster. We illustrate how changes in suitable thermal habitat of important commercially fished species may impact local fishing communities and potentially impact major fishing ports along the U.S. Northeast Shelf. Given the complications of multiple drivers including species interactions and fishing pressure, it is difficult to predict exactly how species will shift. However, observations of species distribution shifts in the historical record under ocean warming suggest that temperature will play a primary role in influencing how species fare. Our results provide critical information on the potential for suitable thermal habitat on the U.S. Northeast Shelf for demersal species in the region, and may contribute to the development of ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies in response to climate change.},

We compiled a database of coastal surveys around North America from 1968 to 2011, sampling 128 million individuals across 360 marine taxa. Climate velocity explained the magnitude and direction of shifts in latitude and depth much more effectively than did species characteristics. Our results demonstrate that marine species shift at different rates and directions because they closely track the complex mosaic of local climate velocities.{\textbackslash}backslashnLocal Speeding{\textbackslash}backslashnEarly responses of species to climate change seemed to predict a general poleward response (or upward in mountains and downward in the ocean).

Two parameterization configurations of the coarse-resolution model are used yielding a three-model suite with significant variation in the transient climate response (TCR). The variation of TCR in this suite and in an enhanced group of 10 GFDL models is found to be strongly associated with the control climate Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) magnitude and its decline under forcing. We find that it is the AMOC behavior rather than resolution per se that accounts for most of the TCR differences. A smaller difference in TCR stems from the eddy-resolving model having more Southern Ocean surface warming than the coarse models.},

	title = {Testing candidate indicators to support ecosystem-based management: {The} power of monitoring surveys to detect temporal trends in fish community metrics},
	abstract = {Community metrics describe aspects of community structure and are often calculated from species-size-abundance data collected during fish stock monitoring surveys. Several community metrics have been proposed as indicators to support ecosystem-based fishery management. These metrics should be sensitive to fishing impacts and respond rapidly to management action, so that managers can assess whether changes in the fish community are a desirable or undesirable response to management. It should also be possible to estimate metrics with sufficient precision so that changes in the community can be detected on management time scales of a year to a few years. Here, we test the power of a large-scale annual trawl survey (North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey, IBTS) to detect trends in six community metrics: mean length, mean weight, mean maximum length, mean maximum weight, slope of the biomass size spectrum, and mean trophic level. Our analyses show that the power of the trawl survey to detect trends is generally poor. While community metrics do provide good long-term indicators of changes in fish community structure, they are unlikely to provide an appropriate tool to support short-term management decisions. If fish community metrics are to provide effective support for ecosystem-based management, and management time scales cannot be extended, then the power of many surveys to detect trends in fish community structure will need to be improved by increased replication and standardization.

Thus, it is important that management objectives are linked to monitoring objectives. This linkage requires a definition of what constitutes a management-relevant ?temporal trend.? It is also important to develop expectations for the amount of time required to detect a trend (i.e., statistical power) and for choosing an appropriate statistical model for analysis. We provide an overview of temporal trends commonly encountered in fisheries management, review published studies that evaluated statistical power of long-term trend detection, and illustrate dynamic linear models in a Bayesian context, as an additional analytical approach focused on shorter term change. We show that monitoring programs generally have low statistical power for detecting linear temporal trends and argue that often management should be focused on different definitions of trends, some of which can be better addressed by alternative analytical approaches.},

Total zooplankton counts increased to above average levels in 1989 and stayed over or close to average through 2004. This analysis identified a group of taxa including Centropages typicus, Metridia lucens, and Temora longicornis that had similar interannual patterns of abundance. All these taxa increased sharply in the early 1990s and remained high through 2001. Some taxa declined sharply in 2002, others have continued elevated through 2004. Total zooplankton counts in the past two years were also boosted by a substantial increase in the abundance of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Evidence is presented that these changes may be related to variations in Scotian Shelf inflow, which freshened water on the Northeast US continental shelf, perhaps increasing both primary production and the influx of zooplankton into the region. There was a positive correlation between the biomass of pelagic predators and the abundance of several zooplankton taxa, suggesting that bottom-up processes and advective supply are the key factors that regulate the Georges Bank foodweb.},

Significant interannual changes in phytoplankton abundance were identified in the Continuous Plankton Recorder time-series collected in the Gulf of Maine from 1961 to 2008. Abundance levels of nearly all the common taxa began to increase in 1990 and remained elevated through 2001. During that period, total numbers were above average throughout the year, with an unusual bloom in late summer. Multivariate analysis of abundance identified three consecutive multiyear periods of varying abundance levels: low to average from 1961 to 1989, above average or very high from 1990 to 2001, and below average thereafter, through 2008. Phytoplankton abundance patterns were closely aligned to the rising trends displayed by several of the common zooplankton taxa. The North Atlantic Oscillation was the only environmental variable examined that showed some association with time-series abundance trends of plankton. The index was primarily positive in the 1990s, which would favour the propagation of warm, nutrient-rich slope water into the region. Perhaps the increased influx of this water, along with feedback enrichment from abundant zooplankton stocks and reduced top-down control by the relative scarcity of the dominant copepod Calanus finmarchicus, combined with a low salinity to make the 1990s a unique decade for plankton change in the Gulf of Maine.},

The continued natural and now technological disasters in the Gulf of Mexico have placed a great deal of strain on communities dependent upon both commercial and recreational fishing. In 2008 a two-year long study to develop social indicators of vulnerability and resiliency for fishing-reliant communities in the Gulf of Mexico was undertaken. In addition, as part of the research design the accuracy of the social indicator descriptions of these places with ethnographic studies was triangulated. Comparisons of the combined ethnographic rankings with the quantitative indicators were positive and statistically significant. The research design thus confirmed that the developed indicators were, in fact, reliable measures for the concepts under consideration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Increasing population pressure, declining fish stocks, and the attractiveness of natural amenities have all led to demo-graphic shifts and economic transformations for many coastal communities dependent on fishing. This impact of " gentrification " on the commercial fishing industry often precipitates a move toward non-marine based economies that can displace local resi-dents and their dependence on fishing as a way of life with resulting impacts to local economies and cultures. Drawing on the United States Census, National Marine Fish-eries Service, and other secondary data sources, social indicators were developed for 2,948 coastal communities in the Eastern United States and Gulf Coast and were used to evaluate gentrification pressure in select communities highly engaged in fishing. We anticipate this methodology, when groundtruthed and then combined with time-series assessments, will lead to improvements in the assessment of fishing community vulner-ability and resilience for the conduct of fisheries social impact assessments.},

Although sustainable development indices have been created and implemented at national and regional levels, few are available at the local or community level, and even fewer address the social aspects of U.S. fisheries. We developed a suite of social indicators for use in fisheries social impact assessment (SIA). Data from more than 2,900 coastal communities in 19 states from Maine to Texas were used to create 14 social vulnerability and fishing dependence indices. Each index was developed using a factor analysis of secondary data obtained primarily from government sources, supplemented by a few private sources. The availability of these secondary data ensure replicability and feasibility under the time constraints usually available for completing social impact assessments for fishery management plans. Using cluster analysis, we selected a group of 20 communities to evaluate all 14 indices of social vulnerability. These indices can be used for cross-community and cross- regional comparisons, and will eventually be incorporated into social impact assessments of all U.S. marine fisheries.},

	abstract = {During the past half-century notable changes have occurred in the Northeast U.S. (NEUS) Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). To understand how the system functions as a whole, to evaluate the potential responses of this ecosystem to numerous human-induced perturbations, and to elucidate the relative magnitude of key biota and processes, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center instituted the Energy Modeling and Analysis eXercise (EMAX). The primary goal of EMAX was to establish an ecological network model (i.e., a more nuanced energy budget) of the entire Northeast U.S. food web. The EMAX work focused on the interdisciplinary development of a network model which reflected contemporary conditions (1996–2000) in four major regions of the ecosystem:, Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, Southern New England and Middle Atlantic Bight. The model had 36 network “nodes” or biomass state variables across a broad range of the biological hierarchy within each trophic level and incorporated a wide range of key rate processes. Because this ecosystem has been relatively well studied many of the biomass estimates were based on field measurements and biomass estimates from the scientific literature were required only for a relatively small number of nodes. The emphasis of EMAX was to explore the particular role of small pelagic fishes in the ecosystem. Our results show that small pelagic fishes are indeed keystone species in the ecosystem. We examined a suite of novel ecosystem metrics as we compared the four regions and provided a general, system-level description of the NEUS ecosystem. The general patterns of the network properties in the four regions were similar; however the network indices and metrics did reveal some noteworthy differences among regions reflecting their different oceanographic and faunal characteristics. The process of compiling and evaluating available data required by an ecosystem network model identified important gaps in our understanding which should be addressed during future ecosystem surveys. Moreover, exercises like EMAX will be a valuable starting point as we continue to progress towards ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM).},

We describe the diagnostics that can be used to check for thermodynamic and ecological principles, and highlight principles that should be used for balancing a model. We then highlight the pitfalls when comparing Ecopath models using Ecological Network Analysis indices. For dynamic simulations in Ecosim we show the state of the art in calibrating the model by fitting it to time series using a formal fitting procedure and statistical goodness of fit. Finally, we show how Monte Carlo simulations can be used to address uncertainty in input parameters, and we discuss the use of models in a management context, specifically using the concept of ‘key runs’ for ecosystem-based management. This novel list of best practices for EwE models will enable ecosystem managers to evaluate the goodness of fit of the given EwE model to the ecosystem management question.},

	abstract = {The MARMAP hydrographic data set (1977–1987) is used to determine the mean annual cycle of temperature, salinity, and density structure of surface waters throughout the Gulf of Maine. The temperatures follow the expected seasonal warming and cooling pattern. In the eastern Gulf the salinity cycle is dominated by influx of low salinity Scotian Shelf water which enters near Cape Sable in the winter, and in the western Gulf by the local spring runoff. Phasing of temperature and salinity cycles in different parts of the Gulf results in the western Gulf of Maine being more strongly stratified in the summer and more vertically uniform in the winter than is the eastern Gulf. The interannual variability, derived by subtracting the annual cycles from the original data, reveals relatively little temperature variability (1–2°C) during the period 1977–1987, compared to observed changes of 4–6°C in previous decades. Large interannual changes in salinity (0.5 psu), however, are evident in the data. The salinity variability is shown to be due primarily to changes in local fresh water sources—precipitation and runoff. Comparison of salinity changes in the Gulf of Maine with data from Georges Bank and the Middle Atlantic Bight shows that the salinity variability is coherent over the northeast continental shelf region from the western Gulf (Wilkinson Basin) to Cape Hatteras.},

	abstract = {The circulation in the Gulf of Maine has an important baroclinic component. It appears to be driven mostly by the density contrast between high-salinity slope water which enters from the Atlantic and fresher waters which are formed in the Gulf or which enter from the Scotian shelf. Hydrographie surveys in three successive spring seasons suggest that slope water accumulates in Georges Basin, driving a counterclockwise surface circulation which brings Scotian shelf water westward into the Gulf and contributes to the eastward jet along the inner edge of Georges Bank. The slope water also crosses a sill and enters Jordan Basin, where it provides a potential energy source which may enhance a counterclockwise gyre partly driven by nearshore buoyancy sources and perhaps the wind. The coastal limb of the gyre turns offshore east of Penobscot Bay. Part of the separated coastal current recirculates in Jordan Basin, and part of it continues into Wilkinson Basin, generating a clockwise eddy as it passes over Jeffreys Bank. There is little evidence for recirculating surface flow in Wilkinson Basin. Instead, the surface water appears to split into branches feeding the Jordan Basin gyre, the Georges Bank jet, and an export path to Nantucket Shoals. The Jordan and Georges branches seem to be divided by the denser slope water in Georges Basin, and this may be the central process controlling the vernal intensification of the circulation in the Gulf. A more complete dynamical understanding awaits models which include the baroclinic influence of boundary waters.},

The average temperature and salinity of the bottom water are presented from the different surveys for four regions of the Gulf—Wilkinson, Jordan, and Georges Basins and the Northeast Channel. The spatial variability across the Gulf was larger than the temporal variability in any region. The bottom water originates from Slope Water that enters the Gulf through the Northeast Channel. It is modified within the Gulf by vertical mixing with the near-surface waters of Scotian Shelf origin. A box model for the property changes during the summer-fall period indicates that the advection and mixing processes are of approximately equal importance in determining the bottom water properties. A winter convective input to the bottom layers is shown to occur only from the coastal areas around Wilkinson Basin in years when the surface salinity there was relatively high ({\textbackslash}textgreater33.0‰). Advection and mixing rates calculated by the box model are in agreement with direct measurements of the inflow to the Gulf (Ramp et al., 1985) and mixing estimates from a budget for the intermediate layer waters in the Gulf (Hopkins and Garfield, 1979).},

	title = {Regime {Shift} in the {Gulf} of {Maine}},
	volume = {79},
	abstract = {Conventional wisdom, based on observations spanning two and a half decades (1975–2000), asserts that inflow to the Gulf of Maine (GoM) occurs primarily in two areas: inshore on the Scotian Shelf off Cape Sable, Nova Scotia and on the eastern side of the Northeast Channel (NEC). In particular, the monthly mean currents in the eastern NEC have shown persistent inflow at all depths and in all seasons, except for the occasional, but brief, reversals near the bottom ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde200 m). Conversely, the flow on the western side of the NEC is normally directed out of the gulf in the surface layer and at mid-depth, consistent with the clockwise gyre over Georges Bank, but those currents do show relatively frequent reversals to inflow in the deeper layers (150–200 m), in sympathy with the flow on the eastern side. At some point between the year 2000, when the last Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO)/U.S. GLOBEC mooring was removed from the eastern NEC, and 2004, when a new mooring was placed there as part of the U.S. ocean observing array, a transformation occurred. The recent data, collected from a representative location in the eastern NEC, show a strongly seasonal current signal marked by persistent periods of outflow in the deep layers ({\textbackslash}textgreater100 m), particularly in winter. This observation was first reported by Pettigrew et al. (2008), where the outflow currents occasionally extend to the surface layers as well, most notably in the winters of 2004–2005 and 2006–2007. Additional data and analyses reported here suggest that this new mode of behavior in the NEC currents could have important consequences for the GoM ecosystem. Possible causes for this “regime shift” in the NEC circulation and implications for the GoM deepwater nutrient fields and ecosystem are discussed.},

	abstract = {Analysis of three years (October 1993–September 1996) of monthly mean current, temperature and salinity observations from moorings in the major Gulf of Maine (GOM) inflows off southwest Nova Scotia (C2) and in Northeast Channel (NECE) reveals some new features of the annual NECE cycles, including (1) a peak in near-surface ({\textbackslash}textless75m) inflow in spring (vs. late summer at depth), suggesting that dynamic control of shallow and deep layers may be different, (2) a maximum near-surface cross-channel flow toward Georges Bank (GB) in late winter, suggesting a climatological tendency for Scotian Shelf “cross-overs” in that season, and (3) the absence of a significant salinity cycle over most of the water column. Deviations from the annual cycle indicate that the first part of the observation period was characterized by enhanced warm, saline, deep ({\textbackslash}textgreater75m) NECE inflow, followed by later episodes of enhanced cold, fresh inflow at C2 and shallow NECE. Generally, the flow rates at C2 and deep NECE were out of phase, with increased inflow at C2 (deep NECE) associated with reduced inflow at deep NECE (C2) and cooler, fresher (warmer,saltier) conditions at both sites. Freshwater transport anomalies to the Gulf are maximum in the surface layers and largely negative(positive) over the first(last) half of the measurements. The timing of these freshwater inflow variations is consistent with observed fluctuations in hydrographic measurements in the GOM and GB, which reached peak salinities in late 1994, then declined through 1995–1996. Oxygen isotope analysis suggests that almost all of the fresh water present on the central cap of GB in 1996 and early 1997 is of northern (Scotian Shelf) origin as opposed to 1994 and 1995 when Maine River Waters contributed 38 and 26\%, respectively, to the freshwater (relative to 34.8) on the cap. A simple box model driven by observed changes in the boundary fluxes indicates that over the last half of the measurement period (April 1995–September 1996), the volumetric flow rate through the GOM increased by 105m3s−1 (roughly 17\% of the total transport, 5.83×105m3s−1), and that increased freshwater fluxes in the surface layers at C2 and NECE produced a net decrease of 0.73 in the salinity of the outflow waters. Average volumetric transports at C2(NECE) were roughly twice(half) those observed in the late 1970s, but the total is consistent with climtological estimates. The net change in the freshwater fluxes exceeds the total climatological mean estimate. Examination of possible local and remote sources confirms that the origin of the 1996–1997 freshwater anomaly is in the northern Labrador Sea/Baffin Bay and results from exceptionally cold winters in the early 1990s. Analysis of a similar event in the early 1980s suggests their occurrence is part of a quasi-decadal climate signal which follows the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).},

	abstract = {Four years of sustained glider observations are used to compute the seasonal cycle of hydrographic fields in the central Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). Results reveal a large phase lag in near bottom temperatures, with peak values occurring in September at the inner shelf, in October at the mid shelf, and in November at the outer shelf. Unlike the northern MAB, the seasonal cycle explains over 70\% of the near-surface salinity variability. At the inner shelf and offshore near the bottom, however, most of the variance is due to pulses in river discharge and to shifts in the position of the shelfbreak front. Cross-shelf density gradients inshore of the 60-m isobath are dominated by salinity during winter and spring, with temperature contributing significantly from August to October. This is because bottom waters near the coast are warm due to the deepening of the thermocline during fall, but offshore waters are still influenced by the cold pool. The vertical stratification seasonal variability is also large. Early in the year, stratification is small and entirely due to salinity. By May, salinity still dominates vertical gradients near the coast, but temperature and salinity contribute equally to the density stratification offshore. During summer, stratification is dominated by temperature. Temperature interannual variability was small during the sampling period, but surface salinity was anomalously low by 1.2 psu in summer 2006. The anomaly was due to larger than average discharge from the Hudson River in early summer during a period of strong upwelling favorable winds.},

Over the last century, temperatures along the northeastern U.S. coast have warmed at a rate 1.8–2.5 times the regional atmospheric temperature trend but are comparable to warming rates for the Arctic and Labrador, the source of coastal ocean waters north of Cape Hatteras (36°N). South of Cape Hatteras, coastal ocean temperature trends match the regional atmospheric temperature trend. The observations and a simple model show that along-shelf transport, associated with the mean coastal current system running from Labrador to Cape Hatteras, is the mechanism controlling long-term temperature changes for this region and not the local air–sea exchange of heat.},

The XBT temperatures on the Middle Atlantic Bight shelf are binned with 10 km horizontal and 5 m vertical resolution to produce monthly, seasonally, and annually averaged cross-shelf temperature sections. The depth-averaged shelf temperature, Ts, calculated from annually averaged sections that are spatially averaged across the shelf, increases at 0.026 ± 0.001°C yr−1 from 1977 to 2013, with the recent trend substantially larger than the overall 37 year trend (0.11 ± 0.02°C yr−1 since 2002). The Oleander temperature sections suggest that the recent acceleration in warming on the shelf is not confined to the surface, but occurs throughout the water column with some contribution from interactions between the shelf and the adjacent Slope Sea reflected in cross-shelf motions of the shelfbreak front. The local warming on the shelf cannot explain the region's amplified rate of sea level rise relative to the global mean. Additionally, Ts exhibits significant interannual variability with the warmest anomalies increasing in intensity over the 37 year record even as the cold anomalies remain relatively uniform throughout the record. Ts anomalies are not correlated with annually averaged coastal sea level anomalies at zero lag. However, positive correlation is found between 2 year lagged Ts anomalies and coastal sea level anomalies, suggesting that the region's sea level anomalies may serve as a predictor of shelf temperature.},

The mean surface flow over the New Jersey Shelf is 2–12 cm/s down shelf and offshore to the south. The detided root-mean-square (RMS) velocity variability ranges from 11 to 20 cm/s. The variability is on the order of the mean current offshore and several times that of the mean current nearshore. The Hudson Shelf Valley and the shelf break act as dynamical boundaries that define the New Jersey Shelf. The surface flow on the New Jersey Shelf depends on topography, seasonal stratification, and wind forcing. The flow is in the approximate direction of the wind during the unstratified season and more to the right of the wind during the stratified season. During the stratified summer season, the dominant along-shore upwelling favorable winds from the SW drive cross-shelf offshore flow. During the unstratified/well-mixed winter season, the dominant cross-shore NW winds drive cross-shelf offshore flows. During the transition seasons of spring and autumn, along-shore NE winds, often associated with storm events, drive energetic down-shelf, along-shelf flows. The surface transport pathways are either cross-shelf dominated during summer and winter or along-shelf dominated during the transition seasons. The residence time of surface Lagrangian drifters on the New Jersey Shelf ranged from 1 to 7 weeks with summer and autumn showing faster transport than winter and spring.},

	abstract = {The Nantucket Shoals Flux Experiment (NSFE79) was conducted across the continental shelf and upper slope south of Nantucket from March 1979 to April 1980 to study the flow of shelf water from the Georges Bank/Gulf of Maine region into the Middle Atlantic Bight. The experiment included a moored array of current meters and bottom instrumentation deployed at six locations across the shelf and upper slope spanning a depth range from 46 to 810 m, and supporting hydrographic observations. A basic description of the moored current and temperature data is given here with an emphasis on the low-frequency variability. In the summer period (April–August) when the local vertical stratification reached a maximum due to increased surface heating and reduced wind mixing, the mean flow over the shelf at all instruments was primarily along 1ocal isobaths towards the west. The subtidal current fluctuations were coherent both horizontally and vertically over the shelf, but not with current fluctuations observed over the upper slope. The wind stress during summer was weak and only moderately correlated with the subtidal current fluctuations. In the winter period (October–March), when the seasonal thermocline was destroyed and the shelf water locally homogenized by increased surface cooling and wind mixing, the mean currents observed over the shelf were also primarily alongshelf towards the west at speeds comparable to those measured in summer. However, the low-frequency current fluctuations over the shelf were much more energetic in winter. These subtidal current fluctuations were highly coherent horizontally and vertically over the shelf and with surface wind-stress fluctuations (which increased in magnitude by a factor of 5 over the summer period). The most energetic subtidal current events observed over the shelf also tended to extend into the upper slope region. The subtidal currents observed over the upper slope in summer were dominated by three bursts of large eastward currents which correspond to the passage of anticyclonic Gulf Stream warm-core rings near or through the moored army. The effect of these rings on the current field does not appear to penetrate shoreward of the shelf break. In winter only two rings passed near the array and their influence on the observed upper slope currents was unclear owing, in part, to the increased subtidal current variability caused by the stronger synoptic wind forcing in winter. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify possible annual variations in the NSFE79 moored current and temperature data. Significant annual variations were found in the temperature field over the shelf and upper slope and in the low-frequency current variability over the shelf. No significant annual variation was observed in the alongshelf current over the shelf, however, suggesting that there is, at least on time scales of one month and more, a continuous flow of shelf water into the Middle Atlantic Bight from the Georges Bank/Gulf of Maine region. The mean westward volume flux between the 40 and 120 m isobaths observed in NSFE79 was 38.3 ± 6.9 × 104 m3 s−1.},

The gyre circulation appears permanent but the coastal current and upwelling exhibit annual variations of the same order as the means. There is a distinct annual signal in the longshore transport at Cape Sable (maximum westward in winter), whereas the mean transport (0.14 × 106 m4 s−1) is consistent with both geostrophic estimates and budget requirements in the Gulf of Marine. Strong seasonal cycles are also found in the salinity and density fields at Cape Sable which appear to be controlled both by buoyancy input from the coastal current and local mixing effects. A linear diagnostic model indicates that the primary dynamical balance for the circulation is between a longshore pressure gradient and longshore mean density and stratification gradients which have summer maxima. Lesser contributions arise from longshore wind, offshore density gradient and centrifugal upwelling. Tidal rectification, deduced from coherent modulations of the semidiurnal tidal streams and low-frequency currents, supports the Browns Bank gyre circulation and drives both westward and offshore components of the near-bottom flow off Cape Sable. Thus the “centrifugal upwelling” hypothesis fails and the main driving force for Cape Sable upwelling appears to be the longshore density variations maintained by tidal mixing.},

The seasonal mean and subtidal variance (at periods of 2–10 days) of the cross-shelf currents reflect the strong annual cycle in the wind field measured at Sable Island. The mean vertical shear suggests a simple Ekman response to winter increases in the longshore wind component, but this model fails quantitatively because 1) the inferred surface-layer (20 m) transport is much too large and 2) the deep (150 m) “return” flow shows no annual signal. The excessive offshore near-surface transport in winter must be reconciled with the relatively stationary position of the shelf/slope-water boundary (SSB) by invoking intense cross-frontal mixing and/or a seasonal mean alongshore pressure gradient. The seasonal mean longshore currents above the main thermocline appear to he more strongly influenced by energetic topographic Rossby waves than by wind. Weekly sea-surface temperature analyses are used to monitor off-shore forcing reflected by fluctuations in the position of the SSB in the region from 60 to 65°W. The dominant empirical mode of its space-time variance represents a uniform on–offshore translation at very low frequencies. The longshore current variance in the ocean-forced spectral band (periods 10–90 days) is 1) correlated with the low-frequency onshore displacement of the SSB in the deep water on the continental rise and 2) comparable to that in the wind-driven band (periods 2–10 days) from 50 to 150 m at the shelf break. On the shelf, the advective onshore transports of heat and salt exhibit annual cycles similar to those in the wind field, and generally exceed the vertically integrated eddy fluxes by factors of 2–4. However, the combination of observed moan and eddy transport supports excessive alongshore gradients of temperature and salinity in the context of a simple box model, and hence may not be representative of the entire shelf.},

	abstract = {The alternative hypothesis that observed regions of recurrent hypoxia on the New Jersey inner shelf are more related to coastal upwelling than riverine inputs of nutrients was investigated through a series of multidisciplinary research programs beginning in 1993. The largest variations in ocean temperatures along the New Jersey coast, other than seasonal, are found to be caused by episodic summertime upwelling events driven by southwesterly winds associated with the atmospheric Bermuda High. Off the southern coast of New Jersey, topographic variations associated with ancient river deltas cause upwelled water to evolve into an alongshore line of recurrent upwelling centers that are colocated with historical regions of low dissolved oxygen. Recurrent upwelling centers are observed every summer in a 9-year data set. The most significant upwelling events occur in summers following colder than usual falls and winters. Size and duration of individual events are correlated and are found to depend on the wind forcing history that effects the inner side of the Middle Atlantic Cold Pool, the precipitation history that effects the strength of the Hudson River plume, and the mixing storm frequency. Upwelling results in a significant enhancement of particulate organic carbon. The typical carbon enhancement associated with the upwelling is sufficient to deplete 75\% of the oxygen in the bottom water, making it borderline hypoxic. This indicates that topographically controlled coastal upwelling, rather than riverine inputs, is the more probable mechanism for generating the historical regions of recurrent hypoxia observed along the New Jersey coast.},

Impingement of warm-core rings at the shelfbreak generates along-isobath intrusions that grow like Pinocchio's nose, extending hundreds of kilometers to the southwest. By combining satellite and Ocean Observatory Initiative Pioneer Array data and idealized numerical simulations, we discover that the intrusion results from topographically induced vorticity variation of the ring water, rather than from entrainment of the shelfbreak frontal jet. This intrusion of the Gulf Stream ring water has important biogeochemical implications and could facilitate migration of marine species across the shelfbreak barrier and transport low-nutrient surface Gulf Stream ring water to the otherwise productive shelfbreak region.},

	abstract = {Discarding undesirable catch is recognized as a major problem confronting ﬁshery managers. It is widely perceived by managers, however, that reductions in discards can only be accomplished via reductions in good or desirable outputs and technical efﬁciency. Yet there appear to be few studies which actually examine the relationship between discard reduction and technical efﬁciency. In this paper, we present an alternative concept of technical efﬁciency, which explicitly recognizes that measures of technical efﬁciency should be adjusted for discard levels. This is because traditional measures of efﬁciency do not consider the resources used in order to discard. We also offer a framework based on data envelopment analysis for assessing efﬁciency in the presence of undesirable outputs. We examine the relationship between vessel efﬁciency and regulatory discards in the U.S. Georges Bank multi-species otter trawl ﬁshery on a tow-level basis. We then examine differences between efﬁcient and inefﬁcient tows, and extend our results to the trip level. Further examination of trip-level results then yield insights into the potential impact of trip-limit regulations. Results show that in order to reduce discards, vessels are limited in the amount they can increase their total output, and that trip-limit regulations may have unintended consequences.},

It is difficult to predict how these regulations will influence angler participation and recreational fishing mortality. This research integrates a utility-theory consistent model of demand for recreational fishing trips with an age-structured stock dynamics model to provide policy relevant advice to managers of the groundfish fishery in the Northeast United States. The recreational cod and haddock regulations implemented in 2014 have high costs in terms of foregone angler welfare and minimal positive impacts on stock conditions after three years. The ability of policies that generate large amounts of discarding, like high minimum size limits, to meet conservation objectives are also found to be quite sensitive to assumptions about the recreational discard mortality rate.},

Several noninvasive condition measures are available for use, including Fulton's condition factor (K), relative condition factor (Kn), and relative weight (Wr). The use of Wr as a condition measure has increased within several peer- reviewed journals. In 1995 to 1996, survey responses from agency personnel in 48 states indicated that 22 states used Wr as a standard technique, 18 states identified Wr use as occasional, whereas only eight states indicated no Wr use. The regression-line-percentile technique is recommended for developing standard weight (Ws) equations. There are currently Ws equations available for 52 species and three purposeful hybrids. Length-related trends in condition need to be evaluated prior to calculating a population mean Wr. Relative weight target ranges should be adjusted to meet specific management objectives. Relative weight values are influenced by seasonal dynamics. The uses of Wr may go beyond just a measure of fish “plumpness.” Relative weight can serve as a surrogate for estimating fish body composition, as a measure of fish health, and to assess prey abundance, fish stockings, and management actions.},

	abstract = {Ecological land classification systems have recently been developed at continental, regional, state, and landscape scales. In most cases, the map units of these systems result from subjectively drawn boundaries, often derived by consensus and with unclear choice and weighting of input data. Such classifications are of variable accuracy and are not reliably repeatable. We combined geographic information systems (GIS) with multivariate statistical analyses to integrate climatic, physiographic, and edaphic databases and produce a classification of regional landscape ecosystems on a 29 340-km2 quadrangle of northwestern Wisconsin. Climatic regions were identified from a high-resolution climatic database consisting of 30-yr mean monthly temperature and precipitation values interpolated over a 1-km2 grid across the study area. Principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with an isodata clustering algorithm was used to identify regions of similar seasonal climatic trends. Maps of Pleistocene geology and major soil morphosequences were used to identify the major physiographic and soil regions within the landscape. Climatic and physiographic coverages were integrated to identify regional landscape ecosystems, which potentially differ in characteristic forest composition, successional dynamics, potential productivity, and other ecosystem-level processes. Validation analysis indicated strong correspondence between forest cover classes from an independently derived Landsat Thematic Mapper classification and ecological region. The development of more standardized data sets and analytical methods for ecoregional classification provides a basis for sound interpretations of forest management at multiple spatial scales.},

To provide a variety of clustering solutions, the data sets were analyzed by four hierarchical clustering methods. External criterion measures indicated excellent recovery of the true cluster structure by the methods at the correct hierarchy level. Thus, the clustering present in the data was quite strong. The simulation results for the stopping rules revealed a wide range in their ability to determine the correct number of clusters in the data. Several procedures worked fairly well, whereas others performed rather poorly. Thus, the latter group of rules would appear to have little validity, particularly for data sets containing distinct clusters. Applied researchers are urged to select one or more of the better criteria. However, users are cautioned that the performance of some of the criteria may be data dependent.},

A protected areas gap analysis methodology: planning for the conservation of biodiversity. World Wildlife Fund Canada Discussion Paper; i-ii). If marine environments are to be protected from the adverse effects of human activities, then identification of types of marine habitats and delineation of their boundaries in a consistent classification is required. Without such a classification system, the extent and significance of representative or distinctive habitats cannot be recognized. Such recognition is a fundamental prerequisite to the determination of location and size of marine areas to be protected. 2. A hierarchical classification has been developed based on enduring/recurrent geophysical (oceanographic and physiographic) features of the marine environment, which identifies habitat types that reflect changes in biological composition. Important oceanographic features include temperature, stratification and exposure; physiographic features include bottom relief and substrate type. 3. Classifications based only on biological data are generally prohibited at larger scales, due to lack of information. Therefore, we are generally obliged to classify habitat types as surrogates for community types. The data necessary for this classification are available from mapped sources and from remote sensing. It is believed they can be used to identify representative and distinctive marine habitats supporting different communities, and will provide an ecological framework for marine conservation planning at the national level.},

It is suggested that, as a result of these problems, species diversity has become a meaningless concept, that the term be abandoned, and that ecologists take a more critical approach to species—number relations and rely less on information theoretic and other analogies. As multispecific collections of organisms possess numerous statistical properties which conform to the conventional criteria for diversity indices, such collections are not intrinsically arrangeable in linear order along some diversity scale. Several such properties or 'species composition parameters' having straightforward biological interpretations are presented as alternatives to the diversity approach. The two most basic of these are simply ▵1=[n/n—1][1—Σi(N\_i/\_N)2] =the proportion of potential interindividual encounters which is interspecific (as opposed to intraspecific), assuming every individual in the collection can encounter all other individuals, E(Sn) = Σi [1—(N—Nin)/(Nn)] =the expected number of species in a sample of n individuals selected at random from a collection containing N individuals, S species, and Ni individuals in the ith species.},

However, small pelagics are difficult to survey directly, so we developed a novel method of assessing the aggregate abundance of 21 small pelagic forage taxa via predator stomach contents. We used stomach contents collected from 22 piscivore species captured by multiple bottom trawl surveys within a vector autoregressive spatio-temporal model to assess trends of small pelagics on the Northeast US shelf. The goal was to develop a spatial “forage index” to inform survey and (or) fishery availability in the western North Atlantic bluefish ( Pomatomus saltatrix) stock assessment. This spatially resolved index compared favorably with more traditional design-based survey biomass indices for forage species well sampled by surveys. However, our stomach content-based index better represented smaller unmanaged forage species that surveys are not designed to capture. The stomach-based forage index helped explain bluefish availability to the recreational fishery for stock assessment and provided insight into pelagic forage trends throughout the regional ecosystem.},

	abstract = {AbstractMonthly mapped sea level anomalies (MSLAs) of the NW Atlantic in the region immediately downstream of the Gulf Stream (GS) separation point reveal a leading mode in which the path shifts approximately 100 km meridionally about a nominal latitude of 39°N, producing coherent sea level anomaly (SLA) variability from 72° to 50°W. This mode can be captured by use of a simple 16-point index based on SLA data taken along the maximum of the observed variability in the region 33°–46°N and 45°–75°W. The GS shifts between 2010 and 2012 are the largest of the last decade and equal to the largest of the entire record. The second group of EOF modes of variability describes GS meanders, which propagate mainly westward interrupted by brief periods of eastward or stationary meanders. These meanders have wavelengths of approximately 400 km and can be seen in standard EOFs by spatial phase shifting of a standing meander pattern in the SLA data. The spectral properties of these modes indicate strong variability at interannual and longer periods for the first mode and periods of a few to several months for the meanders. While the former is quite similar to a previous use of the altimeter for GS path, the simple index is a useful measure of the large-scale shifts in the GS path that is quickly estimated and updated without changes in previous estimates. The time-scale separation allows a low-pass filtered 16-point index to be reflective of large-scale, coherent shifts in the GS path.},

Emphasizing the need to link indicators to management objectives, indicators from the literature are grouped into four categories, relating to the immediate fisheries resource base (single-species and multispecies indicators) and the wider ecosystem (habitat structure and ecosystem functioning). The usefulness of these indicators is assessed along three dimensions of acceptability among stakeholders, observability, and relation to fisheries management using a traffic light approach. The top ranking indicators are highlighted as a generally good start for any particular fishery management case. It is, however, argued that, even with similar management objectives, indicators need to be specific to both ecosystems and the institutional set-up if they are to be effective for management, and that indicators may consequently differ considerably between individual management applications.},

	abstract = {Indicators are needed to support the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), by providing information on the state of the ecosystem, the extent and intensity of effort or mortality and the progress of management in relation to objectives. Here, I review recent work on the development, selection and application of indicators and consider how indicators might support an EAF. Indicators should guide the management of fishing activities that have led to, or are most likely to lead to, unsustainable impacts on ecosystem components or attributes. The numbers and types of indicators used to support an EAF will vary among management regions, depending on resources available for monitoring and enforcement, and actual and potential fishing impacts. State indicators provide feedback on the state of ecosystem components or attributes and the extent to which management objectives, which usually relate to state, are met. State can only be managed if the relationships with fishing (pressure) and management (response) are known. Predicting such relationships is fundamental to developing a management system that supports the achievement of objectives. In a management framework supported by pressure, state and response indicators, the relationship between the value of an indicator and a target or limit reference point, reference trajectory or direction provides guidance on the management action to take. Values of pressure, state and response indicators may be affected by measurement, process, model and estimation error and thus different indicators, and the same indicators measured at different scales and in different ways, will detect true trends on different timescales. Managers can use several methods to estimate the effects of error on the probability of detecting true trends and/or to account for error when setting reference points, trajectories and directions. Given the high noise to signal ratio in many state indicators, pressure and response indicators would often guide short-term management decision making more effectively, with state indicators providing longer-term policy-focused feedback on the effects of management action.},

	abstract = {Harmful algal blooms caused by Cochlodinium polykrikoides are annual occurrences in coastal systems around the world. In New York (NY), USA, estuaries, bloom densities range from 103to 105mL-1with higher densities (≥104cells mL-1) being acutely toxic to multiple fish and shellfish species. Here, we report on the toxicity of C. polykrikoides strains recently isolated from New York and Massachusetts (USA) estuaries to juvenile fish (Cyprinodon variegates) and bay scallops (Argopecten irradians), as well as on potential mechanisms of toxicity. Cultures of C. polykrikoides exhibited dramatically more potent ichthyotoxicity than raw bloom water with 100\% fish mortality occurring within ∼1 h at densities as low as 3.3 × 102cells mL-1. More potent toxicity in culture was also observed in bioassays using juvenile bay scallops, which experienced 100\% mortality during 3 days exposure to cultures at cell densities an order of magnitude lower than raw bloom water (∼3 × 103cells mL-1). The toxic activity per C. polykrikoides cell was dependent on the growth stages of cultures with early exponential growth cultures being more potent than cultures in late-exponential or stationary phases. The ichthyotoxicity of cultures was also dependent on both cell density and fish size, as a hyperbolic relationship between the death time of fish and the ratio of algal cell density to length of fish was found (∼103cells mL-1cm-1yielded 100\% fish mortality in 24 h). Simultaneous exposure of fish to C. polykrikoides and a second algal species (Rhodomonas salina or Prorocentrum minimum) increased survival time of fish, and decreased the fish mortality suggesting additional cellular biomass mitigated the ichthyotoxicity. Frozen and thawed-, sonicated-, or heat-killed-, C. polykrikoides cultures did not cause fish mortality. In contrast, cell-free culture medium connected to an active culture through a 5 μm nylon membrane caused complete mortality in fish, although the time required to kill fish was significantly longer than direct exposure to the whole culture. These results indicate that ichthyotoxicity of C. polykrikoides isolates is dependent on viability of cells and that direct physical contact between fish and cells is not required to cause mortality. The ability of the enzymes peroxidase and catalase to significantly reduce the toxicity of live cultures and the inability of hydrogen peroxide to mimic the ichthyotoxicity of C. polykrikoides isolates suggests that the toxicity could be caused by non-hydrogen peroxide, highly reactive, labile toxins such as ROS-like chemicals. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {As the mean temperatures of the worlds oceans increase, it is predicted that marine heatwaves (MHWs) will occur more frequently and with increased severity. However, it has been shown that variables other than increases in sea water temperature have been responsible for MHWs. To better understand these mechanisms driving MHWs we have utilized atmospheric (ERA-Interim) and oceanic (OISST, AVISO) data to examine the patterns around southern Africa during coastal ({\textless}400 m from the low water mark; measured in situ) MHWs. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was first used to determine that the atmospheric and oceanic states during MHW are different from daily climatological states. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were then used to cluster the MHW states into one of nine nodes to determine the predominant atmospheric and oceanic patterns present during these events. It was found that warm water forced onto the coast via anomalous ocean circulation was the predominant oceanic pattern during MHWs. Warm atmospheric temperatures over the subcontinent during onshore or alongshore winds were the most prominent atmospheric patterns. Roughly one third of the MHWs were clustered into a node with no clear patterns, which implied that they were not forced by a recurring atmospheric or oceanic state that could be described by the SOM analysis. Because warm atmospheric and/or oceanic temperature anomalies were not the only pattern associated with MHWs, the current trend of a warming earth does not necessarily mean that MHWs will increase apace; however, aseasonal variability in wind and current patterns was shown to be central to the formation of coastal MHWs, meaning that where climate systems shift from historic records, increases in MHWs will likely occur.},

The limit of detection and quantification were 44 and 56 µg/kg, respectively; both below the European legal limit of 160 µg/kg. The repeatability was evaluated with 2 naturally contaminated samples. The relative standard deviation (RSD) calculated was 1.4\% at a level of 276 µg/kg and 3.9\% at 124 µg/kg. Intermediate precision was estimated by testing 10 different samples (mussel and scallop) on three different days and ranged between 2.4 and 9.5\%. The IC(50) values of the phosphatase used in this assay were determined for OA (1.2 nM), DTX-1 (1.6 nM) and DTX-2 (1.2 nM). The accuracy of the method was estimated by recovery testing for OA (mussel, 78-101\%; king scallop, 98-114\%), DTX-1 (king scallop, 79-102\%) and DTX-2 (king scallop, 93\%).

The pre-column oxidation LC-FL method is currently implemented in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. When using this method positive samples are fractionated and two different oxidations are required to confirm the identity and quantity of each PST analogue present. There is a need for alternative methods that are simpler, provide faster turnaround times and have improved detection limits. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) HPLC-MS/MS analysis of PST has been used for research purposes, but high detection limits and substantial sample matrix issues have prevented it from becoming a viable alternative for routine monitoring purposes. We have developed a HILIC UPLC-MS/MS method for paralytic shellfish toxins with an optimised desalting clean-up procedure on inexpensive carbon solid phase extraction cartridges for reduction of matrix interferences. This represents a major technical breakthrough and allows sensitive, selective and rapid analysis of paralytic shellfish toxins from a variety of sample types, including many commercially produced bivalve molluscan shellfish species. Additionally, this analytical approach avoids the need for complex calculations to determine sample toxicity, as unlike other methods each PST analogue is able to be quantified as a single resolved peak. This article presents the method development and optimisation information. A thorough single laboratory validation study has subsequently been performed and this data will be presented elsewhere.},

The Food and Drug Administration has established guidance levels for five groups of natural toxins in shellfish responsible for the following illnesses: amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), azaspiracid shellfish poisoning (AZP), diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), and paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Shellfish hazards for domestic products are managed under the National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP), but at present approved and approved limited use methods are only available for ASP, NSP, and PSP. Shellfish harvesting closures have been required due to DSP toxins in excess of the established regulatory guidance level of 16 µg OA eq./100 g shellfish on the Texas Gulf Coast since 2008, in the Puget Sound region since 2011, and in the New England region since 2015. This report describes the validation of an LC‐MS/MS method for DSP toxins for use in the NSSP for the control of this hazard in clams. Once found to be fit for purpose for clams, the method will be fully validated for the additional matrices of mussel and oyster. Due to the immediate need for approved methods for this toxin group it was felt that submitting this proposal now, with the available full SLV data for clam, was important. Preliminary data is available for mussel and oyster such that the method can be used for these matrices in an approved limited use capacity.},

Most methods used to quantify ruggedness are indices derived from measures of slope and, as a result, are strongly correlated with slope. Using a Geographic Information System, we developed a vector ruggedness measure (VRM) of terrain based on a geomorphological method for measuring vector dispersion that is less correlated with slope. We examined the relationship of VRM to slope and to 2 commonly used indices of ruggedness in 3 physiographically different mountain ranges within the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. We used VRM, slope, distance to water, and springtime bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) adult female locations to model sheep habitat in the 3 ranges. Using logistic regression, we determined that the importance of ruggedness in habitat selection remained consistent across mountain ranges, whereas the relative importance of slope varied according to the characteristic physiography of each range. Our results indicate that the VRM quantifies local variation in terrain more independently of slope than other methods tested, and that VRM and slope distinguish 2 different components of bighorn sheep habitat.},

This report describes the first phase of a project aimed at producing maps of the spatial distributions of marine bird species in U.S. Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) waters that can be used to inform marine spatial planning in the region. Visual sighting survey data from over three decades, contained in the ‘Compendium of Avian Occurrence Information for the Continental Shelf waters along the Atlantic Coast of the U.S.' database, were analyzed to derive seasonal and annual maps of the spatial distributions of 40 marine bird species in U.S. Atlantic OCS waters from Florida to Maine.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates how multi-scale measures of rugosity, slope and aspect can be derived from fine-scale bathymetric reconstructions created from geo-referenced stereo imagery. We generate three-dimensional reconstructions over large spatial scales using data collected by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), manned submersibles and diver-held imaging systems. We propose a new method for calculating rugosity in a Delaunay triangulated surface mesh by projecting areas onto the plane of best fit using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Slope and aspect can be calculated with very little extra effort, and fitting a plane serves to decouple rugosity from slope. We compare the results of the virtual terrain complexity calculations with experimental results using conventional in-situ measurement methods. We show that performing calculations over a digital terrain reconstruction is more flexible, robust and easily repeatable. In addition, the method is non-contact and provides much less environmental impact compared to traditional survey techniques. For diver-based surveys, the time underwater needed to collect rugosity data is significantly reduced and, being a technique based on images, it is possible to use robotic platforms that can operate beyond diver depths. Measurements can be calculated exhaustively at multiple scales for surveys with tens of thousands of images covering thousands of square metres. The technique is demonstrated on data gathered by a diver-rig and an AUV, on small single-transect surveys and on a larger, dense survey that covers over [Formula: see text]. Stereo images provide 3D structure as well as visual appearance, which could potentially feed into automated classification techniques. Our multi-scale rugosity, slope and aspect measures have already been adopted in a number of marine science studies. This paper presents a detailed description of the method and thoroughly validates it against traditional in-situ measurements.},

	abstract = {The characteristics and benefits of ocean color merged data sets created using a semi-analytical model and the normalized water-leaving radiance observations from the SeaWiFS, MODIS-AQUA and MERIS ocean color missions are presented. Merged data products are coalesced from multiple mission observations into a single data product with better spatial and temporal coverage than the individual missions. Using the data from SeaWiFS, MODIS-AQUA and MERIS for the 2002–2009 time period, the average daily coverage of a merged product is ∼25\% of the world ocean which is nearly twice that of any single mission's observations. The frequency at which a particular area is sampled from space is also greatly improved in merged data as some areas can be sampled as frequently as 64\% of the time (in days). The merged data presented here are validated through matchup analyses and by comparing them to the data sets obtained from individual missions. Further, a complete error budget for the final merged data products was developed which accounts for uncertainty associated with input water-leaving radiances and provides uncertainty levels for the output products (i.e. the chlorophyll concentration, the combined dissolved and detrital absorption coefficient and the particulate backscattering coefficient). These merged products and their uncertainties at each pixel were developed within the NASA REASON/MEaSUREs and ESA GlobColour projects and are available to the scientific community. Our approach has many benefits for the creation of unified Climate Data Records from satellite ocean color observations.},

	doi = {10.1890/08-0879.1},
	abstract = {A major objective of ecology is to understand how ecological processes limit population connectivity and species' distributions. By spatially quantifying ecological components driving functional connectivity, we can understand why some locally suitable habitats are unoccupied, resulting in observed discontinuities in distribution. However, estimating connectivity may be difficult due to population stochasticity and violations of assumptions of parametric statistics. To address these issues, we present a novel application of Random Forests to landscape genetic data. We address the effects of three key ecological components on Bufo boreas connectivity in Yellowstone National Park: ecological process, scale, and hierarchical organization. Habitat permeability, topographic morphology, and temperature-moisture regime are all significant ecological processes associated with B. boreas connectivity. Connectivity was influenced by growing-season precipitation, 1988 Yellowstone fires, cover, temperature, impervious surfaces (roads and development), and topographic complexity (56\% variation explained). We found that habitat permeability generally operates on fine scales, while topographic morphology and temperature-moisture regime operate across multiple scales, thus demonstrating the importance of cross-scale analysis for ecological interpretation. In a hierarchical analysis, we were able to explain more variation within genetic clusters as identified using Structure (a Bayesian algorithm) (74\%; dispersal cover, growing-season precipitation, impervious surfaces) as opposed to between genetic clusters (45\%; ridgelines, hot, dry slopes, length of hot season, and annual precipitation). Finally, the analytical methods we developed are powerful and can be applied to any species or system with appropriate landscape and genetic data.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems are characterized by many complex interactions. Fisheries managers face the challenge of maintaining or restoring sustainability for individual living resources which are affected by both ecological and economic interactions with other species, through processes like predation and fishing fleet interactions. These species interactions are further complicated by interactions with habitats that are changing due to both human activities and climate change. Often, fishery management systems designed to promote sustainability of individual resources have few tools or processes that also address interactions between species, fleets, habitat, and climate. Here, we review existing and potential fishery assessment and management information and tools, and we develop a potential framework for addressing interactions in management at the request of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. The structured framework can be used to first prioritize interactions, second specify key questions regarding high priority interactions, and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them. The primary tools for the initial steps in the framework are risk assessment and Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Finally, implemented management would be evaluated to ensure that objectives are being met, or to adjust measures as conditions change. In the final section, we outline an example to illustrate how a structured decision making process within the framework could work.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2015.04.005},
	abstract = {After 16 years under a limited access program with effort controls, the New England groundfish fishery transitioned to a catch share management system in 2010. For much of its earlier management history, issues related to fishing capacity were paramount as effort controls were increasingly restrictive to meet biological objectives. As the size of the active fleet declined from over 1000 vessels from 1994 to 2001 to less than 400 vessels in 2012, the management concern shifted to fleet diversity. Fleet diversity has been cast in terms of vessels based on characteristics such as size, gear, and region rather than their share in landings or economic value. Measuring fleet diversity with indices commonly used in the biodiversity literature such as richness, effective diversity based on the Shannon index, and evenness appears appropriate for this context. In this paper these indices were applied to measure changes in diversity of the active New England groundfish fleet from 1996 to 2012. Fleet diversity as measured by the Shannon Index has declined by approximately 35\% from 1996 to 2012, but has remained relatively stable since 2007. Forty vessel types were present in all 17 years, which accounted for about 85\% of active groundfish vessels and over 90\% of total groundfish landings in all years. Even though the fleet size and overall diversity have declined the “core” groundfish fleet remains stable.},

	abstract = {Trends in Canadian temperature and precipitation during the 20th century are analyzed using recently updated and adjusted station data. Six elements, maximum, minimum and mean temperatures along with diurnal temperature range (DTR), precipitation totals and ratio of snowfall to total precipitation are investigated. Anomalies from the 1961–1990 reference period were first obtained at individual stations, and were then used to generate gridded datasets for subsequent trend analyses. Trends were computed for 1900–1998 for southern Canada (south of 60°N), and separately for 1950–1998 for the entire country, due to insufficient data in the high arctic prior to the 1950s. From 1900–1998, the annual mean temperature has increased between 0.5 and 1.5°C in the south. The warming is greater in minimum temperature than in maximum temperature in the first half of the century, resulting in a decrease of DTR. The greatest warming occurred in the west, with statistically significant increases mostly seen during spring and summer periods. Annual precipitation has also increased from 5\% to 35\% in southern Canada over the same period. In general, the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation has been increasing due mostly to the increase in winter precipitation which generally falls as snow and an increase of ratio in autumn. Negative trends were identified in some southern regions during spring. From 1950–1998, the pattern of temperature change is distinct: warming in the south and west and cooling in the northeast, with similar magnitudes in both maximum and minimum temperatures. This pattern is mostly evident in winter and spring. Across Canada, precipitation has increased by 5\% to 35\%, with significant negative trends found in southern regions during winter. Overall, the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation has increased, with significant negative trends occurring mostly in southern Canada during spring. Indices of abnormal climate conditions are also examined. These indices were defined as areas of Canada for 1950–1998, or southern Canada for 1900–1998, with temperature or precipitation anomalies above the 66th or below the 34th percentiles in their relevant time series. These confirmed the above findings and showed that climate has been becoming gradually wetter and warmer in southern Canada throughout the entire century, and in all of Canada during the latter half of the century.},

	abstract = {One of the commonly used tools for detecting changes in climatic and hydrologic time series is trend analysis. A number of statistical tests exist to assess the significance of trends in time series. One of the commonly used non-parametric trend tests is the Mann-Kendall trend test. The null hypothesis in the Mann-Kendall test is that the data are independent and randomly ordered. However, the existence of positive autocorrelation in the data increases the probability of detecting trends when actually none exist, and vice versa. Although this is a well-known fact, few studies have addressed this issue, and autocorrelation in the data is often ignored. In this study, the effect of autocorrelation on the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic is discussed. A theoretical relationship is derived to calculate the variance of the Mann-Kendall test statistic for autocorrelated data. The special cases of AR(I) and MA(1) dependence are discussed as examples. An approximation to the theoretical relationship is also presented in order to reduce computation time for long time series. Based on the modified value of the variance of the Mann Kendall trend test statistic, a modified non-parametric trend test which is suitable for autocorrelated data is proposed. The accuracy of the modified test in terms of its empirical significance level was found to be superior to that of the original Mann-Kendall trend test without any loss of power. The modified test is applied to rainfall as well as streamflow data to demonstrate its performance as compared to the original Mann-Kendalltrend test. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Hydrometeorological data are commonly serially dependent and thereby deviate from the assumption of independence that underlies the Spearman rho trend test. The presence of autocorrelation will inﬂuence the signiﬁcance of observed trends. Speciﬁcally, the positive autocorrelation inﬂates Type I errors, while it deﬂates the power of trend detection in some cases. To address this issue, we derive a theoretical formula and recommend an appropriate empirical formula to calculate the rho variance of dependent series. The proposed procedure of the variance correction for the Spearman rho method is capable of mitigating the effect of autocorrelation on both, Type I error and power of the test. Similar to the Block Bootstrap method, it has the advantage that it does not require an initial knowledge of the autocorrelation structure or modiﬁcation of the series. In comparison, the capability of the Pre-Whitening method is sensitive to model misspeciﬁcation if the series are whitened by a parametric autocorrelation model. The Trend-Free Pre-Whitening method tends to lead to an overestimation of the statistical signiﬁcance of trends, similar to the original Spearman rho test. The results of the study emphasize the importance of selecting a reliable method for trend detection in serially dependent data.},

Furthermore, it was shown that removal of a positive serial correlation component from time series by pre-whitening resulted in a reduction in the magnitude of the existing trend; and the removal of a trend component from a time series as a ﬁrst step prior to pre-whitening eliminates the inﬂuence of the trend on the serial correlation and does not seriously affect the estimate of the true AR(1). These results indicate that the commonly used pre-whitening procedure for eliminating the effect of serial correlation on the MK test leads to potentially inaccurate assessments of the signiﬁcance of a trend; and certain procedures will be more appropriate for eliminating the impact of serial correlation on the MK test. In essence, it was advocated that a trend ﬁrst be removed in a series prior to ascertaining the magnitude of serial correlation. This alternative approach and the previously existing approaches were employed to assess the signiﬁcance of a trend in serially correlated annual mean and annual minimum streamﬂow data of some pristine river basins in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that, with the previously existing procedures, researchers and practitioners may have incorrectly identiﬁed the possibility of signiﬁcant trends. Copyright  2002 Environment Canada.

	abstract = {Short time series are common in environmental and ecological studies. For sample sizes of 10 to 50, I examined the performance of methods for adjusting confidence intervals of the mean and parameters of a linear regression for autocorrelation. Similar analyses are common in econometric studies, and serious concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the common adjustment approaches, especially for estimating the slope of a linear regression when the explanatory variable has a time trend. Use of a bias-corrected estimate of the autocorrelation, either in an adjusted t test or in a two-stage approach, outperformed other methods, including maximum likelihood and bootstrap estimators, in terms of confidence interval coverage. The bias correction was, however, sometimes awkward to apply. It was generally better to test for autocorrelation at the 0.5 level and use ordinary least squares if the test was not significant, although this pretesting mainly helped for weak autocorrelation and small sample sizes. For the best methods, the coverage was sometimes still substantially less than the stated 95\% when autocorrelation was strong, even for sample sizes as large as 50. This was true for estimates of the mean, the regression intercept, and, when the explanatory variable had a time trend, the slope. Simulation results and an example show that different adjustment methods can produce substantially different estimates and confidence intervals. Cautious interpretation of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests is recommended.},

	abstract = {Studying trends in ice freeze-up and break-up dates as well as ice cover duration on lakes, which are sensitive to the air temperature, provides us useful information about climate change and linkages to atmospheric teleconnection patterns. Such data, however, typically show a positive serial correlation, which implies that a high/low observation tends to be followed by a high/low observation in the future. Such serial correlation among data is known to lead to deﬂation of p-values and related inﬂation of signiﬁcance levels of most statistical procedures and tests, making the obtained results unreliable. In particular, we show that the classical statistical approaches, e.g., Student’s t- and Mann–Kendall tests, which assume independence of data, are inappropriate when a serial correlation is present. To overcome the problem, we suggest sieve bootstrap approaches which take into account the serial correlation of data for trend tracking in order to obtain more accurate and reliable estimates. We compare and discuss the results on the classical and newly proposed statistical approaches for the trend analysis using freeze-up and break-up dates as well as ice cover observations from Lake Baikal for the period 1869–1996 and Lake Kallavesi freeze-up dates data from 1834 to 1996. Remarkably, some recent studies of the Kallavesi freeze-up and the Baikal break-up dates, performed under the assumption of independence, report p-values that are relatively close to the border of statistical signiﬁcance and, hence, provide some doubts in existence of a linear trend. In contrast, after taking into account the dependence structure of the observed data, the newly derived p-values have raised to an insigniﬁcant level, which implies no sufﬁcient evidence for existence of a linear trend. The new bootstrap-based approaches also yield substantially less signiﬁcant results for the existence of a trend for freeze-up dates and ice cover duration for Lake Baikal than reported earlier.},
