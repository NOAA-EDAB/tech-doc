## Methods
Diversity estimates have been developed to understand whether specialization, or alternatively stovepiping, is occurring in fisheries of the Northeastern Large Marine Ecosystem. We use the average effective Shannon indices for species revenue at the permit level, for all permits landing any amount of [NEFMC](https://www.nefmc.org/) or [MAFMC](http://www.mafmc.org/) Fishery Management Plan (FMP) species within a year (including both Monkfish and Spiny Dogfish). We also use the effective Shannon index of fleet revenue diversity and count of active fleets to assess the extent to which the distribution of fishing changes across fleet segments.

### Data sources
Data for these diversity estimates comes from a variety of sources, including the Commercial Fishery Dealer Database, Vessel Trip Reports, Clam logbooks, vessel characteristics from Permit database, WPU series producer price index. These data are typically not available to the public.

### Data extraction 
The following describes both the permit-level species and fleet diversity data generation. Price data was extracted from the Commercial Fishery Dealer database (CFDERS) and linked to Vessel Trip Reports by a heirarchical matching algorithm that matched date and port of landing at its highest resolution. Code used in these analyses is available upon request.

Output data was then matched to vessel characteristics from the VPS VESSEL data set. For the permit-level estimate, species groups are based off of a slightly refined NESPP3 code (Table \@ref(tab:spp-groupings)), defined in the data as "myspp", which is further developed in the script to rectify inconsistencies in the data.


```{r spp-groupings, eval = T}
raw.dir <- here::here("data")
spp <- read.csv(file.path(raw.dir,"spp_groupings.csv"),stringsAsFactors = F)
spp <- spp %>%
  dplyr::rename( 'Common Name' = COMNAME,
          'Scientific Name' = SCINAME) %>%
  dplyr::select(Group, NESPP3, 'Common Name', 'Scientific Name')
 
knitr::kable(spp, caption="Species grouping", booktabs=T, longtable = T) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("repeat_header","scale_down"), font_size = 5) %>%
  kableExtra::collapse_rows(columns = 1)

```


For the fleet diversity metric, gears include scallop dredge (gearcodes DRS, DSC, DTC, and DTS), other dredges (gearcodes DRM, DRO, and DRU), gillnet (gearcodes GND, GNT, GNO, GNR, and GNS), hand (gearcode HND), longline (gearcodes LLB and LLP), bottom trawl (gearcodes OTB, OTF, OTO, OTC. OTS, OHS, OTR, OTT, and PTB), midwater trawls (gearcode OTM and PTM), pot (gearcodes PTL, PTW, PTC, PTE, PTF, PTH, PTL, PTO, PTS, and PTX), purse seine (gearcode PUR), and hydraulic clam dredge (gearcode DRC).Vessels were further grouped by length categories of less than 30 feet, 30 to 50 feet, 50 to 75 feet, and 75 feet and above. All revenue was deflated to real dollars using the "WPU0223" Producer Price Index with a base of January 2015. Stata code for data processing is available [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/tech-doc/tree/master/data/Human_Dimensions_code).

### Data analysis
This permit-level species effective Shannon index is calculated as 
$$exp(-\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{ijt}ln(p_{ijt}))$$
for all $j$, with $p_{ijt}$ representing the proportion of revenue generated by species or species group $i$ for permit $j$ in year $t$, and is a composite of richness (the number of species landed) and abundance (the revenue generated from each species). The annual arithmetic mean value of the effective Shannon index across permits is used as the indicator of permit-level species diversity. 

In a similar manner, the fleet diversity metric is estimated as 
$$exp(-\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{kt}ln(p_{kt})) $$
for all $k$, where $p_{kt}$ represents the proportion of total revenue generated by fleet segment $k$ (gear and length combination) per year $t$. The indices each run from 1996 to 2017. A count of the number of fleets active in every year is also provided to assess whether changes in fleet diversity are caused by shifts in abundance (number of fleets), or evenness (concentration of revenue). The work is based off of analysis conducted in @eric_m_thunberg_measures_2015 and published in @gaichas_framework_2016.

### Data processing

Catch and fleet diversity indicators were formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using the R script  found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_commercial_div.R).

### Plotting

Code for plotting the catch and fleet diversity indicator can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions.Rmd-comm-div.R). 

```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-commercial-div.R"), fig.cap = "Fleet diversity and fleet count in the Mid-Atlantic.", fig.align="center", eval=T, echo=F}
