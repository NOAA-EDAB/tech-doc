## Methods
An index of stomach fullness was calculated from NEFSC autumn bottom trawl food habits data, as a simple ratio of estimated stomach content weight to total weight of an individual fish. Stomach fullness may be a better measure than absolute stomach weight if combining across species into a feeding guild, to prevent larger animals with heavier stomachs from dominating the index. An average stomach fullness was calcuated annually for each species and Ecological Production Unit (EPU).

### Data sources
Stomach contents weights and individual fish weights (both to the nearest gram) were collected on the NEFSC bottom trawl surveys from 1992-present aboard RVs Albatross IV, Delaware II and the Henry B. Bigelow (see [Food Habits Database (FHDBS)](https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport) for access procedures).

### Data extraction 
NEFSC food habits data summarized in the R data file allfh.RData were obtained from Brian Smith (Brian.Smith@noaa.gov) for this index.

### Data analysis
The stomach fullness index was calculated using the R script found [here](https://github.com/Laurels1/StomachFullness). 

### Data processing
Fish stomach fullness index was formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using this [R code](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_stom_fullness.R). Stomach fullness was expressed as an annual anomaly for each species in each region.
