## Methods

### Data sources
All recreational shark fishing indicator data were downloaded from the Marine Recreational Information Program [MRIP Recreational Fisheries Statistics Queries](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/recreational-fisheries/data-and-documentation/queries/index) portal. 

From the main [Recreational fisheries statistics queries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/data-tools/recreational-fisheries-statistics-queries) page, the [download query](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/SASStoredProcess/do?) link is available. From here the following selections made include:

| Prompt            | Selected                            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Minimum Year      | 1981                                |
| Maximum Year      | *Max year available                 |
| Data Type         | Estimate: Catch                     |
| Wave Options      | All Waves                           |   
| Geographical Area | Not Specified                       |
| Species           | *26 Species outlined in table below |
| Output            | Download CSV as ZIP File            |

The ZIP file was used in the following analysis. 


### Data analysis

Data regions "4 = New England" and "5 = Mid-Atlantic" were selected for to remove data from regions not relevant to the State of the Ecosystem reports. The data were then grouped into categories using the table below. This species list was the list used in the above "species" section in the MRIP query.  Data were grouped by year, category and region, and the sum of all the landings for each was used as the indicator for recreational shark harvest. 

| Category       | Common Name          | Species Name                 |
