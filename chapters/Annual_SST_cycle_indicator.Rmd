## Methods

### Data sources
Data for annual sea surface tempature (SST) cycles were derived from the NOAA optimum interpolation sea surface temperature (OISST) high resolution dataset ([NOAA OISST V2 dataset](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html)) provided by NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory's Physical Sciences Devision, Boulder, CO. The data extend from 1981 to present, and provide a 0.25&deg; x 0.25&deg; global grid of SST measurements [@reynolds_daily_2007]. Gridded SST data were masked according to the extent of Ecological Production Units (EPU) in the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem (NE-LME) (See ["EPU_Extended" shapefiles](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/tech-doc/tree/master/gis)).


### Data extraction 
Daily mean sea surface temperature data for 2017 and for each year during the period of 1981-2012 were downloaded from the NOAA [OI SST V2 site](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html) to derive the long-term climatological mean for the period. The use of a 30-year climatological reference period is a standard procedure for metereological observing [@wmo_wmo_2017]. These reference periods serve as benchmarks for comparing current or recent observations, and for the development of standard anomaly data sets. The reference period of 1982-2012 was chosen to be consistent with previous versions of the State of the Ecosystem report.
