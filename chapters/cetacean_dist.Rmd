## Methods

### Data sources
Data collected during NMFS aerial and shipboard line transect abundance surveys (Palka et al. 2021). Processed data are available at https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-PSB-AMAPPS-public


### Data analysis
Centroid of spatial density distribution map from each season and species in 2010 was then compared to the corresponding season and species in 2017 (Chavez-Rosales et al. 2022). 

### Data processing
Line transect data were processed using standard 2-team Distance sampling analysis methods, then used in generalized additive models to describe the spatiotemporal habitat-density relationships (Chavez-Rosales et al. 2022).

The Cetacean distribution shifts indicator was formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using the R script  found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_cetacean_dist.R).
