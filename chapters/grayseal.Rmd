## Methods


### Data sources
Reported harbor porpoise bycatch estimates and potential biological removal levels can be found in publicly available documents; detailed in [Marine Mammal Protection Stock Assessments](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessment-reports-region). More detailed documentation as to the methods employed can be found in NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Center Reference Documents (CRDs) found on the NEFSC [publications page](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/science-data/northeast-fisheries-science-center-publications). 


### Data extraction 
Annual gillnet bycatch estimates are documented in the CRDs. These feed into the Stock Assessment Reports which report both the annual bycatch estimate and the mean 5-year estimate. 

### Data analysis
Bycatch estimates as found in stock assessment reports were plotted along with confidence intervals. The confidence intervals were calculated from published CVs assuming a normal distribution ($\sigma = \mu CV$; $CI = \bar{x} \pm \sigma * 1.96$).

Data were analyzed and formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using the R code found here, [Gray Seal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/data-raw/get_grayseal.R).
