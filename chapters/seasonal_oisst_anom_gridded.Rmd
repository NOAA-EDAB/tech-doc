## Methods

### Data sources
Data for seasonal sea surface tempature anomalies were derived from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administartion optimum interpolation sea surface temperature high resolution data set ([NOAA OISST V2](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html)) provided by NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory's Physical Science Division, Boulder, CO. The data extend from 1981 to present, and provide a 0.25&deg; x 0.25&deg; global grid of SST measurements [@Reynolds2007]. 


In 2021, the Daily OISST data was updated and there are a couple papers describing and comparing the new version [@Huang2021assessment, @Huang2021improvements]. 


### Data extraction 

Individual files containing daily mean SST data for each year during the period of 1981-present were downloaded from the [OI SST V5 site](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html). Yearly data provided as layered rasters were masked according to the extent of Northeast US Continental Shelf. Data were split into three month seasons for (Winter = Jan, Feb, Mar; Spring = Apr, May, Jun; Summer = July, August, September; Fall = Oct, Nov, Dec).  

This is done in a GitHub action and is available online in [`ecopull`](https://github.com/kimberly-bastille/ecopull/actions). 

### Data analysis
We calculated the long-term mean (LTM) for each season-specific stack of rasters over the period of 1982-2010, and then subtracted the (LTM) from daily mean SST values to find the SST anomaly for a given year. The use of climatological reference periods is a standard procedure for the calculation of meteorological anomalies [@WMO2017]. Prior to 2019 State of the Ecosystem reports, SST anomaly information made use of a 1982-2012 reference period. A 1982-2010 reference period was adopted to facilitate calculating anomalies from a standard [NOAA ESRL](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html) data set.

R code used in extraction and processing [gridded](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_seasonal_oisst_anom_gridded.R)  and [timeseries](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_seasonal_oisst_anom.R)  data can found in the `ecodata` package.
