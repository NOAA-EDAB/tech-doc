## Methods
### Data sources
The data used in community climate vulnerability analyses were derived from the following sources in partnership with the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program's (ACCSP) Standard Atlantic Fisheries Information System (SAFIS).

```{r source table, echo = F, include = T, results='asis'}
tabl <- '
|Database Name     | Description                                  |

|Cfdersyyyy|The dealer data are transaction-level pricing at the level of the "market-category." These data are primarily generated through mandatory reporting by federally-permitted fish dealers. The federal reporting is supplemented with data from non-federally-permitted (state-only) fish dealers. Data are currently reported electronically in partnership with ACCSP through SAFIS.           |

In these databases, the variable "port" contains the post associated with the vessel. The variable "Statenm" refers to the state of the mailing address of the owner.

### Data extraction 
Code for plotting the community climate vulnerability indicator can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/tech-doc/tree/master/R/stored_scripts/comm_climate_vuln_extraction.sql). 


### Data analysis

The results described below were developed using the methodology described in @colburn_indicators_2016.

1.  *Mapping community climate vulnerability* - The map was produced using two variables: total value landed in a community and community species vulnerability, defined below:
    a.  Communities were grouped based on total value of landings into the following categories: 1 (<\$ 200,000), 2 (\$200,000-\$9,999,999), 3 (\$10,000,000-\$49, 999,999), and 4 (\$50,000,000 and above). Only communities with a total value landed of \$200,000 or more were selected for the mapping process.
    b.  Community climate vulnerability is determined by the percent contribution of species classified as very high, high, moderate, or low climate vulnerability in a community. The percent contribution of species is calculated as following: 


        * **% VH & H** = value of landing contributed by species classified as having very high or high climate change vulnerability/total value of landings \* 100

        * **% M** = value of landing contributed by species classified as having moderate climate 
change vulnerability/total value of landings \* 100

        * **% L** = value of landing contributed by species classified as having low climate change 
vulnerability/ total value of landings \* 100

If a community received a dominant score (50% or more) for any of the above categories, % VH &, %M, or %L, then the community received a respective community species vulnerability ranking of High, Moderate, or Low.  For example, if 90% of the total value landed a community is contributed by species classified as having very high or high climate change vulnerability, then this community gets "Very High/High" community species vulnerability. In case of no dominant percentage identified, the community gets a "Mixed" community species vulnerability ranking. 

2.  *Pie charts* - The pie charts were created using the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) landings data pulled from New England Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) databases in Woods Hole, MA. The percent contribution of each species was calculated by dividing the total value of landings in each port by each species' landed value.  Data was calculated and graphed in a pie chart in Excel and given the colors that represent High (red), Moderate (blue), Low (yellow) climate vulnerability. The "other" category consists of species with low landings and/or those that do not have a vulnerability ranking based on @Hare2016.  These species were aggregated and given the color gray.
