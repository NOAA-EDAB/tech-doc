## Methods


### Data sources
Data for the Chesapeake Bay seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are derived from the AVHRR and VIIRS Multi-Sensor Composite Sea Surface Temperature data set, available from the NOAA CoastWatch East Coast Regional Node (https://eastcoast.coastwatch.noaa.gov/). The data set is a composite of overpasses from two instruments: the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on the European MetOp satellites, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the S-NPP and NOAA satellites (starting with NOAA-20 and follow-on NOAA satellites). Data from all current operational satellites are used in order to increase geographic coverage on a per-day basis. SST is derived using the Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Oceans (ACSPO) processing system for consistency across instruments (@petrenko_evaluation_2014; @petrenko_sensor-specific_2016). Only nighttime overpasses are incorporated into the composite, i.e. the data do not represent daytime solar heating of the water surface. The data extend from December 2006 to the present. The AVHRR 1 km spatial resolution data, and the VIIRS 750 m spatial resolution data, are co-gridded to an 830 m spatial grid.

### Data analysis
Individual nighttime overpasses from all instruments on the current operational satellites are composited into daily gridded scenes. The daily gridded scenes are then averaged seasonally. A long-term ‘climatological’ seasonal average SST is generated for each season for the years from 2007 to the year immediately prior to the current year (max(Year) - 1). This reference period serves as a benchmark for comparing current observations. The current-year seasonal SST is then subtracted from the long-term seasonal average for all grid cells to create the anomaly map. Seasons for Chesapeake Bay are Dec-Feb (winter), Mar-May (spring), Jun-Aug (summer), and Sep-Nov (fall).
