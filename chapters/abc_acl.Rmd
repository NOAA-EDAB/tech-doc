## Methods

### Data Sources

These data were compiled from MAFMC [Fishery Information Documents](https://www.mafmc.org/fishery-performance-reports), Stock Assessment reports, [SSC reports](https://www.mafmc.org/ssc), GARFO catch/landings database, and MRIP queries. 

### Data Analysis

Each stock has a threshold and catch value assigned to it from the sources above. The table below shows where the information comes from for each stock.

Allowable Biological Catch (ABC) for each managed stock is set by the MAFMC Science and Statistical Committee(SSC), Annual Catch Limit (ACL) (if appropriate) is developed by the Council; recreational data come from [MRIP](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/recreational-fishing-data) (Marine Recreational Information Program), commercial catch from either the NEFSC assessment lead or GARFO database. 

Each species, depending upon data availability, sectors, fleets etc., goes through a different data processing process. 

### Data Processing 

Data were formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using the R code found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_abc.acl.R).
