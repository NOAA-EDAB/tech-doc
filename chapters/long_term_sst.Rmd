## Methods
Data for long-term sea-surface temperatures were derived from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) extended reconstructed sea surface temperature data set (ERSST V5). The ERSST V5 dataset is parsed into 2&deg; x 2&deg; gridded bins between 1854-present with monthly temporal resolution. Data were interpolated in regions with limited spatial coverage, and heavily damped during the period between 1854-1880 when collection was inconsistent  [@huang_noaa_2017; @huang_extended_2017]. For this analysis, 19 bins were selected that encompassed the Northeast US Continental Shelf region [see @friedland_long-term_2007]. 


### Data sources
This indicator is derived from the [NOAA ERSST V5 dataset](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.ersst.v5.html) [@huang_extended_2017].


### Data extraction 

```{r coordinates, echo = F, eval = T, results='asis'}
df <- data.frame(  
  Longitude = c(-74,-74,-72,-70,-70,-70,-68,-68),
  Latitude = c(40,38,40,44,42,40,44,42)
)

knitr::kable(df,
             caption="Coordinates used in NOAA ERSST V5 data extraction.",  booktabs=T) #%>%
  #kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F) 
```

R code used in extracting time series of long-term SST data can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/tech-doc/tree/master/R/stored_scripts/long-term-sst-extraction.R).

### Data Processing

Data were formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package with the R code found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_long_term_sst.R).
